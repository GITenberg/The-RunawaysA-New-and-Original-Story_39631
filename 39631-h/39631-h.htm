<h2>NAT GOULD: AN APPRECIATION.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 512px;">
<img src="images/portrait.png" width="512" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">NAT GOULD'S novels
of the Turf are read
and enjoyed by multitudes
of men and
women all over the
world. That in itself
is a guarantee of literary
merit. Had he
been a stylist, the sale
of his hundred odd
books would never
have run into a score
of millions. He wrote
to please and not to puzzle, to give pleasure and not
to educate, and his reward came in the gratitude of a
host of admirers of clean, healthy fiction.</p>

<p class="indent">His main theme was the King of Sports and the
Sport of Kings. Nat Gould dearly loved a horse,
and so does the great British public, including those
who have no liking for racing. It is a characteristic
as national as our admiration of ships, sailors and the
sea. The theme fascinated him, and, combined with
a gift for writing, was one of the secrets of his success.
Another reason for his almost boundless popularity is
to be found in the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of his stories, which
is created without elaborate literary setting. The
machinery of it is hidden by reason of its very artlessness.
The romance is told in a plain, straightforward
way that carries intense conviction, and though the
plots are neither subtle nor involved, they are unfolded
in so vigorous and lifelike a manner that few
people who pick up one of Nat Gould's novels are
able to put it down before having finished the last
chapter. Few modern writers can boast that they
are read and understood at a single sitting.</p>

<p class="indent">His novels ring true. They are clean, manly and
sincere. There is nothing vicious about them. As
<i>The Times</i> truly said of Nat Gould in its obituary
notice of him, &quot;He must have written some millions
of words, but few of them were wasted, if a rattling
good story makes a reader happier and more contented
for having read it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Such praise is praise indeed, for literature that is
involved and appeals to a select few obviously cannot
have the influence of literature that embraces so large
a section of the population. To have added to the
enjoyment of so vast a number of young and old,
rich and poor, were a monument worthy of any man.</p>

<p class="indent">Nathaniel Gould was born in Manchester in 1857,
and died in 1919. His wide experience as a journalist
in England and Australia doubtless explained
his methods of rapid workmanship, while his travels
in the Antipodes and elsewhere afforded him that
&quot;local colour&quot; which is not the least pleasing characteristic
of his novels. He not only wrote of outdoor
life, but enjoyed it, for racing, driving and gardening
were his hobbies.</p>

<h3>AS THE SNOW FALLS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Redmond Maynard</span> stood at the dining-room
window gazing at the deep-dyed reflection upon
the snow of the blood-red setting sun. The
leafless trees, with their gnarled trunks and gaunt,
twisted branches, spreading fiercely in imprecation
at the hardness of their lot, resembled giant
monsters from an unknown world. These diseased
protruding growths put on all manner of fantastic
shapes, as his eyes dwelt first upon one, then
upon another. It was the shortening winter's
day drawing near a close, and a spirit of melancholy
brooded over the landscape. On such an
evening as this, the thoughts of thinking men
are apt to draw comparisons which bring vividly
before them the uncertainty of life, and the
prospects of that something after death which
has never been understood, never will be, until
each one solves the problem by going out into
the eternal night.</p>

<p class="indent">It seemed to Redmond Maynard that he was
peering into a mystery he had no hope of solving.
He was not a godless man, neither was he a man
whose life had been altogether well spent. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
mistakes had been many; he acknowledged this,
and thereby robbed his detractors of selfish
victories. Slowly the sun sank, and as it dipped
lower and lower into obscurity the red shadows
on the snow grew fainter, the harshness melted,
and a gentle warmth seemed to mingle with the
biting cold. The glow remained some time after
the sun had disappeared, and Redmond Maynard
stood in the same position watching it.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, almost without warning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&quot;Out of the bosom of the air,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Out of the cloud folds of her garment shaken&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i2">Over the woodlands brown and bare,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Over the harvest fields forsaken,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Silent and soft and slow,</span><br />
<span class="i2">  Descended the snow.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">It came fluttering down from the &quot;bosom of
the air,&quot; to nestle in the bosom of the earth, to
mingle with the white mantle lying there, to lie
pure and undefiled until an angry thaw turned
all its beauty into dulness and decay. How
gently the flakes fell, and Redmond Maynard
watched them with the warm glow from the
fire shedding flickering light behind and around
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I draw the curtain, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The man silently left the room, sighing as he
did so, thinking to himself, &quot;It's two years
come to-night since Mr. Ulick left home. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
wonder will he come back. The Squire's thinking
of it now. God help 'em both.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There will be no darkness to-night,&quot; muttered
Redmond Maynard, as he saw a silvery ray cross
the lawn in front of the house. No darkness,
perhaps not, but in his heart there was a desolate
feeling deeper than the blackness of night.
Two years ago Ulick Maynard walked out of
that very room, and had not since returned.
Bitter words were spoken between father and
son. Both were proud. The accusation fell
upon Ulick like a thunderbolt; for the moment
he was stunned. Then, with his frozen blood
bursting into a fiery torrent, he hurled back the
insult his father had put upon him. He stayed
not to think what causes led Redmond Maynard
to make the charge. In his mind no evidence,
however conclusively circumstantial, ought to
have been considered sufficient to make his
father speak such words.</p>

<p class="indent">The elder man recoiled under the shock.
Given an opportunity, he would have recalled
his words. But the chance was not allowed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Believing, as you must, or you would not
have accused me, that I am guilty of this infamy,
I will no longer inflict my presence upon you,
sir. Good-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No more, no less; those were the very words,
and Ulick Maynard left the room. That was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
two years ago, and nothing had been heard of
him since.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ulick!&quot; called his father, as the door closed
behind him. &quot;Come back at once. Ulick!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No answer was returned, and the still angry
man thought, &quot;He'll get over it by morning.
Gad, what a devil of a temper he has. He's the
culprit, safe enough, although Eli will not hear
of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick Maynard did not &quot;get over it by morning.&quot;
He disappeared, and his father had never
been the same man since. Without drawing
the curtains, Redmond Maynard left the window,
and, walking to the fireplace, stood with his
back to the blaze.</p>

<p class="indent">Stretched on the hearthrug was a strong,
powerful, shaggy wolf-hound. Bersak raised
his long, lean head, and looked at his master,
but observing no sign that his services were
required, stretched himself out again at full
length with a sigh of satisfaction. There was
ample room between the dog and the hearth
for his master to stand, and Redmond Maynard
looked down upon him from a height of nearly
six feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His dog,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Bersak, where's
Ulick?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The hound sprang to his feet and stood alert,
every nerve strained, head erect, listening for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
footsteps he had not heard for two years, but
which he would have recognised even amidst the
deadening snow. Man and dog looked at each
other. That question had been asked before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bersak, where's Ulick?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rather shaky the tones this time, and something
in them affected the hound, for he lifted
up his head and whined; the sound would have
developed into a howl, but Redmond Maynard
placed his hand on his head and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't howl, Bersak, I could not stand it.
Lie down. Good dog, lie down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Obedient to the word of command, Bersak
lowered himself&mdash;no other word adequately expresses
the dog's movement,&mdash;to the hearthrug,
and with his fore-paws stretched out watched
the Squire's face.</p>

<p class="indent">How much would Redmond Maynard have
given to see the door open and his son Ulick
walk in. All he possessed&mdash;aye, more, many
years of his life. He knew how Bersak would
have leapt [to] his feet with a mighty bark of
welcome, and a spring forward until his strong
paws reached Ulick's shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">He fixed his eyes on the door, and as he did
so it opened. But it was not Ulick entering,
although the newcomer brought a faint smile
on his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Irene!&quot; he exclaimed, as the vision in furs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
came across the fire-lit room; &quot;this is good of you.
However did you get here; is it still snowing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Squire, it is not snowing, although there
is plenty of snow; and as to how I came here,
well&mdash;look at my boots,&quot; and she held up her
dress and disclosed a pair of strong &quot;lace-ups,&quot;
fitting perfectly her well-shaped feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you walked all the way from the Manor,
and with the express object of cheering a lonely
old man on a depressing winter's evening. I
call that good of you, positively charitable, but
Irene Courtly's name is ever associated with
good works,&quot; said the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid the good work on this occasion
is closely allied with selfishness,&quot; she replied,
smiling. &quot;Being alone, I appreciate the feelings
of others similarly situated, and that is how I
came to think of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Alone!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Where is Warren?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gone to London. Important business. No
hunting, you see, Squire,&quot; she said, with a laugh
he thought had not a very true ring about it.</p>

<p class="indent">Redmond Maynard gave an impatient gesture,
and Bersak pushed his head against her hand
in doggish sympathy. Irene Courtly noticed
the movement, and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He really had to go; he assured me it was
absolutely necessary,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly had also added. &quot;I'll be back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
in a few days, Irene. Run over and see the Squire,
you will be company for each other.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You cannot humbug me, Irene,&quot; said Redmond
Maynard. &quot;He's tired of the country
because there is no sport, and I call it downright
selfish of him to go up to town and leave you
behind at Anselm Manor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, really, I did not wish to go, Squire.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, most decidedly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then pull off those furs; let me send Bob
over for your things and your maid, and stay
here until Warren returns,&quot; said the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">This time the laugh was hearty enough, and
she said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Impetuous as ever, Squire. I only wish I
could.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what is to prevent your doing so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My duty towards my neighbours,&quot; said
Irene, laughing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Love your neighbour as yourself, and I am
your nearest neighbour,&quot; he answered.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, going to the window, he opened it, and,
putting out his arm for a few moments, drew it
in again and showed her the snowflakes on his
coat-sleeve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You cannot possibly return to the Manor
in such weather,&quot; he said, and touched the
bell.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>&quot;Can you drive, or ride, to Anselm Manor,
Bob?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">The man shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll try, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take the old mare and 'the tub,' and bring
Mrs. Courtly's maid back. She will know
what her mistress requires.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir, I'll manage it,&quot; replied Bob Heather,
with alacrity.</p>

<p class="indent">Mary Marley, Mrs. Courtly's maid, was Bob
Heather's favourite, and he had an idea she
preferred him to any of her admirers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The maid did it,&quot; said the Squire, with a
smile. &quot;I doubt if he would have undertaken
the journey for the luggage alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene laughed, and then, in a serious mood,
said, as she stroked Bersak's head, &quot;Do you
think it right for me to remain here. You are
my oldest friend, and my guardian until I married
Warren. Ought I to stay?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, of course,&quot; he replied impatiently.
&quot;It is snowing fast again. Warren would not
expect you to go home on such a night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She settled down to spend a quiet evening
with him. She knew what this night meant to
him, what it might have meant to her had all
gone well with Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">Watching him as he sat with the firelight on
his face, she noticed how he had aged during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
past year. No, not aged exactly, for he was still
a firm, strong, active man; but there was
something in his noble, if severe, face that told
of a great struggle racking him within.</p>

<p class="indent">She knew the largeness of his heart, and his
notions of honour, which many modern hypocrites
laughed at, because their little minds
could not grasp his greatness. She remembered
how he guarded her [as] his own child when her
father, Colonel Carstone, died and left her as
a legacy to his old friend. He brought her as a
girl of sixteen to Hazelwell, and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Irene, this is your home. Your father gave
you to me, and it is a sacred gift. You will
get on with Ulick, he is a good lad, and you
have known each other for some years. Hazelwell
will be the brighter for your presence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She revered Redmond Maynard above all
men, and whatever he did she considered right,
until&mdash;until Ulick left his home.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is thinking of him now,&quot; she thought.
&quot;Oh, why does he not come home? The old
scandal is dead; I have forgiven him, surely
he has&mdash;he must.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bersak sat with his head in her lap looking
into her face, his sharp, keen eyes blinking, and
occasionally he turned to look at the silent figure
in the chair. Irene did not disturb him, but to
know his thoughts she would have given much.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>She saw his hands clench the chair tightly&mdash;sure
sign of a strong man's emotion.</p>

<p class="indent">Quietly she rose from her seat, took a footstool,
placed it beside him, and sat at his
feet. She laid her head on his knee; Bersak
followed her and lay at her feet. They formed
a pretty group in the firelight's glow. The
room was warm and cosy, although large;
outside, the snow was still falling, adding
steadily to the frozen mass upon which it
descended.</p>

<p class="indent">Redmond Maynard placed his hand on her
head and gently stroked her hair. She remained
silent and quite still.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is like old times to have you here again,&quot;
he said at length.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I am very glad to be with you. Will
you play chess, shall I read to you, or will you
talk?&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Being a woman, Irene, I will talk to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I such a chatterbox?&quot; she answered,
laughing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not that, anything but that. You speak
when you have something to say; you are not
an aimless chatterer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Warren says my tongue is never still.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Warren is an ass,&quot; he snapped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear no, not at all. He is by no means
stupid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>&quot;I retract; I ought not to have made use of
the expression.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will keep it to myself in strict confidence,&quot;
she replied, with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">The door opened, and a maid said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I light the lamps, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The room was soon aglow with a soft, delicate
light, and as the maid went out she said to
herself&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I never. The ways of these gentry
are past me. Fancy her sitting like that, and
going to stop here all night. It's not respectable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was a new maid, with a narrow mind
and a relaxable conscience, which could be
stretched to any required length to suit her
own purposes.</p>

<p class="indent">The maid, the luggage, and Bob Heather duly
arrived. Bob had taken good care Mary Marley
should not be cold during the drive.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you tired, Irene?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. I will sit up until you are ready to
go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An hour longer, and then I shall pack
you off,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall be up all night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All night?&quot; she exclaimed, in surprise,
&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>&quot;Because it is the night, two years ago, that
Ulick left home. I sat up all night on this date
last year. I know it will be on a night such as
this he will come back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-night, not to-night? Will he come
home to-night?&quot; she asked, eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How can I tell, child? If he does not I
must wait another year,&quot; he said, sadly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have forgiven him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; but not his sin,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you sure, quite sure, it is his sin?&quot; she
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Unfortunately, there is no doubt about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Eli Todd&mdash;&mdash;&quot; she commenced.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is wrong,&quot; he answered. &quot;He is blinded by
his faith in Ulick. Eli would sacrifice even more
than he has done for him, and God knows how
he has suffered.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish we had Eli's faith,&quot; she replied.

<h2><a name="CII" id="CII"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE RUNAWAYS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a stud of thoroughbreds at Hazelwell,
not large, but select, some of the mares boasting
of blue blood such as can seldom be obtained
after much search. Eli Todd was the manager
of the stud, and lived in a small but picturesque
and comfortable cottage on the estate. He
served in the &mdash;th Hussars with Colonel Carstone,
and during the time they were in India he acquired
a considerable knowledge of horses of every
description. He handled the Colonel's &quot;Walers,&quot;
and broke them in cleverly; he also trained the
Colonel's horses for the races, and on one occasion
had the audacity to declare he meant to win the
Viceroy's Cup for his master, a feat he all but
accomplished, as the Scout ran a good second
for that coveted trophy.</p>

<p class="indent">When Colonel Carstone died, and Irene was
committed to the care of Redmond Maynard,
Eli Todd entered his service at the same time. It
was owing to Irene that he did so. She persuaded
her guardian that Eli was a veritable
wonder in the management of horses, and that
she was perfectly certain that if his services
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
were secured Hazelwell Stud would benefit
thereby.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick Maynard backed up her recommendation,
declaring he had cast curious eyes upon
Eli ever since he returned from India with the
Colonel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lose no time in securing him,&quot; said Ulick;
&quot;such a man will be snapped up at once. Don't
lose him whatever you do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Redmond Maynard engaged Eli to manage
his stud, and also to superintend the hunters
and all the horses on the estate&mdash;a step he had
never regretted. Eli was a widower with one
child, a daughter, Janet Todd. She was about
the same age as Irene, and a bright, merry,
mischievous, exceedingly pretty girl. Vanity
was her besetting sin, but apart from this she
was of an amiable disposition, and innocent of
any desire beyond harmless flirtations. Naturally
her father idolised her, and it was mainly on
her account he accepted the position Mr. Maynard
offered him.</p>

<p class="indent">The night that Redmond Maynard sat
up, hoping against hope that his son would
return, Eli Todd was in a troubled state of
mind.</p>

<p class="indent">Like his master, he dated the great misfortune
of his life two years back from that night. He
recalled vividly how his daughter Janet had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
kissed him good-night and then gone to bed.
Her manner gave no indication of what was
to befall during the next few hours.</p>

<p class="indent">He remembered how he sat waiting for her
to come down to breakfast, wondering what
kept her so long. Her room was above that in
which he sat, and he heard no movement on
the floor above. The strain became too great,
and at last he could bear it no longer. He did
not ring for the housekeeper, but crept upstairs
and tapped gently at her door. There was no
answer, and as he sat now, two years after, he
felt again the throbbing of his heart in anticipation
of some unknown evil he experienced on
that occasion. He knocked again, and then
slowly, noiselessly opened the door.</p>

<p class="indent">The room was empty, the bed had not been slept
upon. Dazed and bewildered, he failed at first
to understand what it meant. The stillness
stunned him, and he groped his way forward
like a blind man. Mechanically he ran his hands
over the spotless counterpane, seeking, feeling
for that he knew he should not find. He looked
under the bed, in a closet, and even in her wardrobe;
she was hiding, playing him a trick, but
where had she hidden herself?</p>

<p class="indent">He sat down in the chair at her bedside and
looked helplessly about the room. He fingered
the candlestick which stood on a small table near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
the bed, examining it with unusual interest.
There was an old pair of snuffers there, and he
took them up and pressed the wick, which stuck
fast, and the candle with the snuffers attached
fell on the table. He put the empty candlestick
on the bed and got up.</p>

<p class="indent">Walking to the window, he drew up the blinds
and looked round the room again. He was near
the dressing-table, and picked up one article
after another. He did not look for a letter, a
brief note; he would not have found one had
he done so. She had gone, left him desolate
without one parting word.</p>

<p class="indent">Still in a dazed condition, and not fully realising
his loss, he went out of the room, closing the
door after him, and stumbled downstairs.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Marley, his housekeeper, heard him, and
came into the room,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is Janet ill?&quot; she asked, in a tone of concern.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, in a hollow voice. &quot;I will
take her breakfast upstairs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can take it myself,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; please let me do it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, but you spoil her, Mr. Todd; it
is not good for her,&quot; said Mrs. Marley.</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed strangely, and she looked at him
in surprise. He took the tray upstairs, placed it
on the table at the bedside, and locked the door
as he came out, putting the key in his pocket.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
Why he did this he failed to understand, except
that he wanted time to think.</p>

<p class="indent">He was going over again everything that
happened that terrible night. He had considered
it many times, and he would not lay the guilt
at Ulick's door; no, not even after two years
of grave suspicion, which had not yet been
removed. He once more saw the door open
and Ulick Maynard come in out of the snowy
night. He heard the startled cry Janet gave
as she sprang from her chair, and her exclamation,
&quot;Mr. Ulick, what are you doing here?&quot; rang
in his ears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Eli, I want to sit down and think,&quot; Ulick
had said, and, wonderingly, he bade him make
the house his home, as he had always done.</p>

<p class="indent">Janet, pale and bewildered, left the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is anything the matter, Mr. Ulick?&quot; asked Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You'll learn soon enough,&quot; was the vague
reply; and then he saw Ulick take out his
pocket-book and count some notes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have some supper?&quot; said Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I dined at home an hour ago.&quot; Then
he looked hard at Eli. Surely he knew what
people were saying, knew of the gossip about
Janet. It amazed him when he had to acknowledge
that Eli Todd was the only person in the
village who was in ignorance of what concerned
him most.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>&quot;Where's Janet? I must speak to her,&quot;
said Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">Eli called her, and she came slowly into the
room, her face as pale as death.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Ulick wishes to speak to you. I'll leave
you together, I want to look at Blossom again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">What passed between them he never knew;
what he did know was that next morning Janet
was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">As he sat crushed and stunned under the
blow, there came a furious knocking at the
door, and Mrs. Marley called out in an agitated
voice&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's the Squire, and isn't he in a rage!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As Eli sat in his chair by the fire he again
conjured up the picture of Redmond Maynard
striding furiously into the room, knocking the
snow from his boots with his hunting crop.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is my son here, or has he been here?&quot;
he asked, angrily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was here last night,&quot; said Eli, in a hollow
voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And is he here still?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know; he went away after&mdash;after&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After what?&quot; thundered the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After he had seen Janet about something
he wished to say to her,&quot; said Eli, slowly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>&quot;And where is the hussey; d&mdash;&mdash;n it, man,
where is she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Eli strode up to him, and looking him full
in the face, said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not that word from you, Squire, take it
back, take it back; she is my child.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Redmond Maynard controlled his feelings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a hard word, Eli, I ought not to have
used it. You have sufficient to bear without
that,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He knows,&quot; thought Eli. &quot;How does he
know?&quot; and he looked at the Squire, who could
not fail to notice his surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I speak with your daughter?&quot; said the
Squire; and from this Eli knew there was some
mystery he did not yet grasp.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is gone,&quot; he replied, in a low voice,
for the first time acknowledging the dreadful
truth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Left your house!&quot; exclaimed Redmond
Maynard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. I found her room empty this morning,
but I have, so far, concealed her flight from my
housekeeper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Redmond Maynard strode up and down the
room, muttering threats and imprecations.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has stolen her from you, Eli; but he shall
pay for it dearly. He is even a greater scoundrel
than I accused him of being,&quot; said the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>&quot;Do you know who has tempted my daughter
to leave me?&quot; asked Eli, placing his hand on
the Squire's arm in his earnestness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Man, you must know,&quot; replied the Squire,
amazed at his stupidity. &quot;Have you noticed
nothing wrong with her during the past few
weeks?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, my Janet has always been the same to
me until last night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire's rage against Ulick passed all
bounds. He had accused him of trifling with
Janet's affections, and now, to crown his offence,
the graceless fellow had induced her to run away
with him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My son came here last night,&quot; he said. &quot;You
left him alone with your daughter, and it was no
doubt during that time they planned to go away
together. He has taken her from you, Eli, and
I hope he will make her an honest woman. To
think a son of mine should be such a scoundrel.
Ulick, whom I have loved beyond all others,
it is too terrible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At last Eli Todd understood. His daughter,
the pride of his life, the prettiest of all the village
lasses, was a light o' love, and Ulick, his favourite,
to whom he would have entrusted her life, was
accused of betraying her. The shock of this
discovery overwhelmed him, but he had more
faith in Ulick than his father had.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>&quot;If a man has tempted my daughter to leave
my home and follow him, it is not Mr. Ulick,
Squire,&quot; said Eli, solemnly. &quot;He'd never do
it; he'd cut off his right hand first. You wrong
him, and you'll regret the day you taxed him
with such a charge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Redmond Maynard wondered at the man's
faith in his son. To his mind the proof was
clear as day, especially now Janet Todd had
disappeared at the same time as Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your feelings do you credit,&quot; he replied;
&quot;but the evidence is too clear. You know
as well as I that when people hear Ulick and
Janet have disappeared, they will say they went
together. Can it be otherwise? They have
been great friends, constantly meeting, and have
often been seen alone together. My son has
done you a great and grievous wrong, and I must
do all in my power to lessen the blow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll hear no words against Mr. Ulick, Squire.
True, he came here last night, but he left long
before Janet could have gone. I will never
believe it of him. It was not his nature to do
evil. He'll prove it some day. As for my poor
lass, God help her. She'll come back to me
some day, when her heart is sore and aching
for her father's love. Whatever she is, whatever
she may have done, I will never refuse her the
shelter of my home and name. We don't know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
all, Squire; there may be something we cannot
understand, but which will be explained in the
future. But Mr. Ulick! Why, Squire, I'd as soon
accuse myself of crime as him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Two years ago this scene took place between
master and man, and Eli still held firm in his
belief in the stainless honour of Ulick Maynard.
No word had come from Janet during all that
time. Where she was he knew not, but he
thought of her day and night, and as he went
about his work he offered up many a plea for
her return.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Squire 'll be thinking of Ulick to-night,&quot;
he muttered, as he rose from his chair, went to
the door, and looked out into the night.</p>

<p class="indent">Snow was still falling softly, and the moon
bathed the landscape in silvery splendour. As
he looked, he heard the faint, dull sound of a
horse's hoofs on the snow, and the rumble of
clogged wheels.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where can they be going from the house
to-night?&quot; he thought, and then recognised
Bob Heather, seated in &quot;the tub,&quot; and almost
smothered in wraps.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hallo, Eli, that you? A nice job I've got,
fetching Mrs. Courtly's maid, and a heap of
luggage, from Anselm a night like this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Going to Anselm!&quot; exclaimed Eli. &quot;What's
up there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>&quot;Seems to me everything's up. Mr. Courtly's
gone up to London on most important business,
and left Mrs. Courtly alone. He's always
got business in London. I'd know what it was
if I was her. She came over to see the Squire,
and he's made her stop with him. I say, Eli,
don't you think she'd have been a lot better off
if she'd married Mr. Ulick?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mind your own business,&quot; growled Eli.
&quot;It don't concern you; and as to what I think,
I'll keep it to myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's two years since he left us, and the
Squire's been thinking about it all night. He's
got a notion Mr. Ulick will come back at this
time of year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So he will, and I hope my lass will come too,&quot;
said Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You still think they did not go away together?&quot;
asked Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't say that, but I'll swear Mr. Ulick
never harmed a hair of her head,&quot; said
Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's a rum 'un,&quot; thought Bob. &quot;Why,
everybody knows they ran off together; that's
what made the Squire so bitter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have a glass of ale?&quot; said Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks, you keep a better tap than they
have at Hazelwell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I drink it myself,&quot; said Eli, smiling, &quot;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
order it myself. I expect it's not the Squire's
fault if you don't get the best.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, it's not. Old Josh knows how many
beans make five, and I'll bet he charges top
price for the stuff he gets in for us,&quot; said Bob.</p>

<p class="indent">Eli went indoors and came out with a foaming
tankard of ale, which Bob Heather made short
work of.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will keep me warm,&quot; he said, with a
sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have plenty of rugs, are you afraid the
luggage will catch cold?&quot; said Eli, slyly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Luggage be blowed,&quot; said Bob. &quot;These
things are for Mary; she'd never forgive me if
she caught a cold,&quot; and he shook the reins and
proceeded on his journey.</p>

<h2><a name="CIII" id="CIII"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>RANDOM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Squire Maynard</span> remained in the dining-room
throughout the night. Towards morning he fell
asleep in his arm-chair, Bersak watching on the
rug at his feet. It would have gone ill with
the man who attempted to touch the Squire
with Bersak on guard. More than one poacher
had felt the hound's teeth in his calf, and howled
for mercy, and been forgiven on account of the
punishment received.</p>

<p class="indent">Bersak once saved Ulick's life, or if not his
life, at any rate rescued him from being maimed.</p>

<p class="indent">A three-year-old bull attacked him, and there
was no chance of escape. The furious beast had
Ulick at his feet, and was bellowing over him,
as a preliminary to goring him, when Bersak
came to the rescue. The wolf-hound tore across
the field in a direct line for the bull, who,
seeing him, raised his head and bellowed forth
defiance. On came Bersak, and flew straight
at the bull's throat. He tore him terribly,
but the animal could not rid himself of his fierce
enemy. Never had bull such a mauling, and
when Ulick came to himself he saw the dog still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
dragging his enemy down. It was a long struggle,
but Bersak won, and the bull was shot to end
his misery.</p>

<p class="indent">Bersak's fame spread far and wide, and he
had the honour of having several attempts made
upon his life by the bad characters in the district.</p>

<p class="indent">So, while his master slept, Bersak kept watch;
and when the door was opened by Bob Heather
in the morning a faint growl warned the intruder
that his master still slept. He closed
the door and went quietly away, thinking it
was a blessing the Squire had not kept awake
all night.</p>

<p class="indent">A faint light stole into the room as Redmond
Maynard awoke, and at first he looked round,
hardly realising where he was. Then, as he
thought over the events of the previous day, he
said to himself, &quot;Not this year. I must be
patient; perhaps it will be in the next.&quot; Then
he drew aside the curtains and looked again
upon the wintry scene. A good deal of snow
had fallen during the night, and the wind drifted
it against the hedges and the trunks of the huge
oak trees. There was no sign of life until a
hare ran across the lawn into the garden, where
there was a plentiful supply of winter vegetables.
Presently stealing along with his tail out, head
down, and glancing from side to side with a
cunning look, came a fox. He, too, crossed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
lawn in the track of the hare, and the Squire
smiled as he watched him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are having a rest, my friend,&quot; he said;
&quot;but I think you would prefer the hounds at
your heels, and an open country before you, in
preference to all the snow. No hunting for
weeks, that is what it looks like. Deuce take
Warren, I wonder why he always goes to town
when there is an excuse handy. Was I right
in advising Irene to marry him. I think so,
I hope so; but yet I doubt. He is good-looking,
has money, a fine estate adjoining mine, bears a
good character, as young men go, and yet there
is something wanting about him. He must love
Irene, no one could help it, but he has no business
to leave her alone to her own devices. She is
young, has no children yet, nothing to occupy
her mind; no, it is not fair to her. In a hunting
country like this the free-and-easy intercourse
at the meets sometimes leads to danger. Nothing
is meant at first, but gradually acquaintance
ripens into intimacy, and one cannot well decline
to put up a fellow sportsman, even if one's
husband be absent. Irene is to be trusted, I
know, but she is remarkably handsome, and her
good nature is apt to carry her too far in her
efforts to please. If only Ulick had&mdash;but there,
he didn't, so what is the use of thinking about
it. Stupid fellow, not to see his way clear, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
then to disgrace our name beyond all redemption.
I wonder where he is, and where she is?&quot; He
stopped soliloquising, and went to the bath-room,
from whence, in about half-an-hour, he emerged
refreshed and in a more amiable frame of mind.
In the breakfast-room he found Irene.</p>

<p class="indent">She came forward smiling, and kissed him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There, was not that nice? You do not
deserve it though, for you sat up all night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who has been telling tales?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bersak.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed as be said, &quot;And, pray, how is
Bersak to be held responsible?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He took me into the dining-room, and I
followed him to your chair. He stood looking
at it so comically that I had to laugh. He said
as plainly as though he had spoken, 'That's where
he sat all night, and I watched him. No fear
of anyone touching him with me on guard.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wonderful,&quot; laughed the Squire. &quot;Irene,
with Bersak as your instructor and guide, you
would quickly find out all my secrets.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not know you had any.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are not very terrible, but I possess
a few; I must be in the fashion,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have no secrets from Warren. I tell him
everything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder if he tells you everything,&quot; thought
Redmond Maynard, and said aloud, &quot;That's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
right, my dear, never have any secrets from
your husband.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She poured out his coffee for him, and handed
it herself. She tempted him with a dainty
portion of pigeon pie, and then insisted upon
some anchovy paste.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll tell you what it is, Irene; I have not
made such a good breakfast for many a day.
Your presence is appetising.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was pleased to hear him talk in this strain,
more like his old self. Somehow, she did not
miss Warren; she hardly gave him a thought.
As for Anselm Manor, she much preferred Hazelwell,
as it was more like home.</p>

<p class="indent">At the Manor she often felt nervous and
depressed when alone, peopling the old place
with the figures of clean-shaven monks in long
brown gowns, pacing up and down the corridors,
Bible in hand or telling their beads, and thinking
of things earthly while engaged spiritually.</p>

<p class="indent">Anselm Manor, in the centuries gone by,
had been a monastery, and it was an ancestor
of Warren Courtly who founded it. Harry the
Eighth upset many monkish arrangements,
but, strange to say, he allowed Anselm to exist.
The much-married monarch never even visited
the place on a monk hunt, although it contained
much valuable plate, and the eighth Henry
had a penchant for other people's property.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>In Anselm Manor Irene had come across
an old deed, or she fancied it a deed. It looked
dirty and musty, and smelt abominably enough
to be such a document, which, after much labour
in deciphering, she found was a gift in perpetuity
from Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God,
to one Anselm Courtly, of the monastery and
all the lands belonging to it.</p>

<p class="indent">She thought it highly probable that the King
had secured the said Anselm's good offices, at a
price, when some of his numerous matrimonial
troubles arose.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene thought the Manor a fine old place, but
she preferred to see its rooms filled with scarlet
coats to imaginary monkish habits. It was to
get rid of morbid fancies she walked over to
Hazelwell when her husband took his departure
for London. They got on well together, seldom
quarrelled, although there was very little genuine
love on her side.</p>

<p class="indent">About six months after Ulick Maynard left
Hazelwell, Warren Courtly proposed to Irene.
She declined the offer, but subsequently, acting
mainly on her guardian's advice, she accepted
him, and they were married the same year.</p>

<p class="indent">Redmond Maynard watched her moving about
the room, and noticed how daintily she rearranged
the various ornaments and chairs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There,&quot; she said, &quot;that looks much better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>&quot;I agree with you,&quot; he replied. &quot;You have
the artistic temperament strongly developed.
By the way, have you done much painting during
the past few months?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I have painted several pictures, but
three out of every four I destroyed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They did not come up to your expectations?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, and I do not care to keep inferior work.
I think I have painted one that will please you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it&mdash;the subject?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A new departure for me. I have painted
Random; I mean to give it you if you will
accept it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is good of you. I shall be delighted.
Random shall have a prominent place in my
study.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Random was a bright bay horse Redmond
Maynard had given Irene on her marriage.
He was a splendid hunter, either for lady or
gentleman, and before Ulick left the horse had
been his favourite.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene had been given the pick of the Hazelwell
stable, and she selected Random because he had
been Ulick's horse, and she thought, perhaps,
his father would sell him now he was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">Random was duly sent over to Anselm Manor,
and Irene vowed she would not part with him
until Ulick came home, when she would hand
him back to his rightful owner. She had ridden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
the horse in many a fast burst across country,
and he carried her well. He was a safe, fearless
jumper, and Irene was a splendid rider. When
she appeared at a meet on Random, Sam Lane,
the huntsman, thought, &quot;We're in for it to-day;
it will take the best of us all our time to keep
up with Mrs. Courtly on Random.&quot; His surmise
generally turned out correct, and on more than
one occasion he and Irene were the only two
in at the death. Many attempts had been
made by sporting millionaires, American and
otherwise, to secure Random, and a big figure
would have been given for him, but Irene laughed
at their offers, and said a shipload of gold would
not buy him.</p>

<p class="indent">Random was sometimes the cause of dispute
between Irene and her husband. Warren
Courtly was ridiculously jealous of the horse.
He would have scouted the idea that this feeling
was engendered because Random had been
Ulick Maynard's favourite horse, and yet Irene
knew such to be the case. On more than one
occasion he had suggested Random should be
sold, or the Squire persuaded to make an exchange
for him. His excuse was that the horse was
not safe for a lady to ride, too much of a puller,
and so on. Irene remained firm, and declined
to entertain any ideas suggesting a parting with
her favourite.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>&quot;You seem to care more for the horse than
you do for me,&quot; he said, angrily.</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed, and said he must have a very
poor opinion of himself if he thought she preferred
Random.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Maynard was kind enough to give him to
me, and I mean to keep him. Don't let us
quarrel about such a trifle. You would not
like it if I asked you to give up your favourite
hunter for a mere whim of mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has Warren become reconciled to Random?&quot;
asked the Squire. &quot;I cannot understand his
antipathy to the horse. Of course, he is anxious
you should not run into danger, but Random
is a very safe horse to ride&mdash;a more perfect
fencer I have seldom seen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Warren has his likes and dislikes, and when
he makes up his mind he seldom gives in. Random
seems to have been his pet aversion ever since
you gave him to me, and I do not think even
now he would be at all sorry if he met with an
accident, provided I came off scot free,&quot; laughed
Irene.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is ridiculous. I begin to think I urged
you to marry a monument of selfishness; I hope
you will forgive me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You require no forgiveness. You provided
me with a suitable husband and a good home.
Warren is kind to me, and I have everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
my own way. He is not a demonstrative man,
but I feel sure he loves me, and he is not responsible
for his restless disposition&mdash;that is
inherited.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And do you love him, Irene?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">She momentarily hesitated, and then said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I love him. We seem to understand
each other now, although at first there was some
restraint between us. I think we are quite as
happy as the majority of married couples.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was only half satisfied with her answer, but
did not pursue the subject further.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is the painting of Random finished?&quot; he
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but not framed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I send Bob over for it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will ride over myself if you will give me a
mount,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The roads are very bad, will it be safe?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The horse can be 'roughed,' and I shall
enjoy a ride in the keen morning air, it will
brace me up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, Irene. I will order Rupert to be
saddled, he is the safest conveyance you can
have in this weather.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CIV" id="CIV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>IRENE'S PAINTING.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Irene</span> mounted Rupert, and the Squire stood
on the steps in front of the hall-door admiring
the picture. The horse was a dark brown,
nearly black, and stood out prominently against
the snowy background. It was a sharp, crisp
morning, the atmosphere clear, with a touch of
frost in the air, and the sun shone brightly, the
snow quivering in the light, glittering like myriads
of crystals.</p>

<p class="indent">Rupert pawed the gravel in his eagerness to
be going, and the Squire remarked, as he shook
hands with Irene&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must come back as soon as you can. If
you find the picture too cumbersome to carry
leave it and we will send Bob for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can strap it on my back, I have a case made
for the purpose. I often ride out with my sketching
materials strapped on. You would take me
for a tramp if you saw me walking about in my
artist's costume,&quot; said Irene, laughing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A remarkably pretty tramp,&quot; said the
Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks, I will turn that compliment over in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
my mind as I ride to the Manor; it will be pleasant
company for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rupert set off at a brisk trot. He was at all
times a sure-footed horse, and being roughed
he had no difficulty in keeping his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene's colour rose as the sharp breeze fanned
her cheeks, and she was thoroughly enjoying her
ride.</p>

<p class="indent">She went past the stud farm, and came across
Eli Todd, who had been going his rounds.</p>

<p class="indent">Next to his runaway daughter, Janet, Eli Todd
was devoted to Irene. He had known her from a
child, had taught her to ride, and was proud of
her accomplishment. He stood admiring her as
she rode up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-morning, Eli; how are all your pets?
I expect this weather does not suit some of them,
but, of course, you have no foals yet?&quot; said
Irene.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everything is going on well,&quot; he replied;
&quot;but I am a bit anxious about old Honeysuckle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She must be getting on for twenty?&quot; said
Irene.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not far off that, Mrs. Courtly; in fact, I
feel sure she is twenty, only it would not do to
tell the Squire so, because he vows she is only
eighteen, he won't hear of her being more,&quot;
replied Eli, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>&quot;There is not much difference between eighteen
and twenty; but why are you anxious about
Honeysuckle, is there anything seriously amiss
with her? I am going through Helton, and can
ask Bard to call.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">James Bard was the well-known county vet.,
and he lived at the little village of Helton,
giving as his reason, &quot;I prefer Helton; if
I had my residence in the county town, people
would be always demanding my services for all
kinds of frivolous cases; it is a far way to Helton,
and when they take the trouble to come for me
I know the case is worth going to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, thank you,&quot; replied Eli. &quot;It is not
necessary for Jim Bard to be called in, and I
hope it will not be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then what is it?&quot; asked Irene.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The old mare is very heavy in foal, and I'm
mightily afraid the youngster will come into the
world before the first of January, and there's
no need to tell you that would be a misfortune,&quot;
replied Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If he was born on December 31st it would
mean he would be a year old on January 1st,&quot;
said Irene, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's just it, and look what a disadvantage
he would be at all his life. I may be wrong, but
I assure you I am having a very anxious time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you told Mr. Maynard?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>&quot;No, and please say nothing about it to him.
He would only worry, and be constantly backwards
and forwards between the house and the
stables. You know how fond he is of the old
mare.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Honeysuckle is one of his great favourites,
and no wonder; it is a good many years since she
won the Oaks and the St. Leger for him. That
is a fine painting he has of her in his study. I
am afraid my poor effort will look very paltry
beside it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you taken to painting horses?&quot; asked
Eli. He believed Irene capable of doing almost
anything she put her hand to.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have tried to paint Random, and I am
riding over to the Manor for the painting, as
the Squire is anxious to see it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He'll make a grand picture; he's a fine
subject to work on. There are not many hunters
like him in the county. He was Mr. Ulick's
favourite, and I was precious glad when you got
him, for I was very much afraid the Squire would
have sold him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You were very fond of Ulick, were you not,
Eli?&quot; she asked, in a soft tone of voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To my mind there's not a man round these
parts to compare with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you do not believe he ran away with
Janet?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>&quot;He never did that, I'll swear. You know he
was not a man of that sort.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Suspicion was, and still is, strong against
him,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You cannot judge a man on suspicion, and
in your heart you do not believe him guilty,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How can I believe otherwise? Who else
could have done it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish I could find out,&quot; he answered, vehemently.
&quot;I will some day, and then&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Something will happen. When I stand face
to face with the man who stole my girl, he'll
have to look to himself,&quot; said Eli, sternly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think Janet will ever come back?&quot;
she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, as sure as I believe Mr. Ulick will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope you will prove a true prophet,&quot; she
replied. &quot;If Ulick came back to Hazelwell and
cleared himself, it would make a young man of
the Squire. I should like to look round the
stables, but I have no time now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come when you like, I shall be only too
pleased to show you the mares. Don't say anything
to the Squire about Honeysuckle, please,
Mrs. Courtly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will not; I am discretion itself in such
matters,&quot; laughed Irene, as she rode away.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>It was four miles to the Manor, and when
she arrived there she thought how cold and forbidding
the old place looked when compared
with Hazelwell.</p>

<p class="indent">The housekeeper was surprised to see her, and
bustled about briskly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not going to remain long,&quot; said Irene.
&quot;I have merely come for a picture. I suppose
Mr. Courtly has not returned?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, but there is a letter for you, and it is
his handwriting on the envelope.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene went into the morning-room and found
some letters in the basket on the table.</p>

<p class="indent">She opened the one from her husband first.
It was brief and to the point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
&quot;<span class="smcap">Dear Irene</span>,&mdash;I shall not be home for a week.
If you feel lonely, go over to Hazelwell; I am
sure the Squire will give you a warm welcome.
Business must be attended to, you know, and
the Anselm Estate takes a good deal of looking
after. With love, I am, &amp;c., Warren.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Et cetera,&quot; said Irene to herself, smiling.
&quot;That's so like Warren. He is made up of et
ceteras&mdash;it may mean much or little&mdash;it is so
delightfully vague.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A faint odour of perfume was perceptible, and
she wondered where it came from. The letter
was still in her hand, and as she wafted it carelessly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
about she discovered the paper was highly
scented.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's not club paper,&quot; she thought. &quot;Clubs
are too prosaic to have scented paper about,
besides, there is no heading; he must have
written it at some friend's house. But why
should it be a plain sheet with no address?
And what a peculiar scent. My dear Warren,
this requires some explanation; I will carefully
preserve your eloquent epistle. Scented paper
and legal affairs do not go well together,
not in the management of estates, although I
have no doubt breach of promise cases agree
with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She folded the letter, and put it in the drawer
of her writing-desk.</p>

<p class="indent">Two letters were addressed to Warren, and
these she placed on one side; the fourth bore
the London postmark, and she did not know the
writing. The contents puzzled her. The letter
was a request for money to enable the writer to
tide over temporary difficulties. It was signed
Felix Hoffman. She had never heard the name
before. Why did the man write to her? How
came he to know her address? It was a strange
begging-letter, for no hint was given as to the
writer's position, how he came to be in distress,
why he wrote to her, or any information that
was likely to induce her to accede to his request.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
The strangeness of the letter appealed to her. She
firmly believed the man wanted money, also that
he would repay her. There was no whining
about it, none of the professional begging-letter
writer's ways. Half-a-dozen lines, and no sum
mentioned. The address sounded genuine&mdash;25,
Main Street, Feltham, Middlesex. Where was
Feltham? She took up Bradshaw's Guide, and
found it was on the London and South-Western
line, between Waterloo and Windsor. She had
never heard of the place before, although she
must have passed it on her way to Sunningdale
for the Ascot week. Irene was given to making
up her mind on the spur of the moment, and she
did so in this case. She sat down at her desk,
took her private cheque-book out, and sent the
unknown and mysterious Felix Hoffman a cheque
for five pounds.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Easily imposed upon, I suppose that is what
the majority of people would say; at any rate,
if it is an imposition it is an uncommon one.
I have a good mind to go up to London and on
to Feltham just to spy out the land. I will ask
the Squire about it. He will not call me a fool,
he is far too polite, but he'll probably think I
am one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She sealed the letter and placed it in the postbag,
locking it, and thus hiding her missive from
prying eyes. Irene trusted her servants, but she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
understood human nature, and knew curiosity
was well developed in the domestic maiden.</p>

<p class="indent">Passing into the room she used as a studio, she
took the painting of Random from the easel and
placed it in a more favourable light.</p>

<p class="indent">She criticised it, and was more than satisfied
she had done the horse justice. The colouring
was right, not hard, or harsh; the coat was not
too glossy, yet it showed signs of health. The
head was as perfect as it well could be. The
left eye&mdash;the horse had his head turned three-parts
round&mdash;was perhaps a shade too dull. She
took up her palette, and with a couple of light
touches altered it to her satisfaction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think he will like it, and not merely because
I have done it, but because it has merit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She placed it in her portfolio, and adjusted the
straps to suit her shoulders, so that it would not
interfere with her riding. She rang the bell, and
Mrs. Dixon, the housekeeper, appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has anyone called, Dixon?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; we need not look out for visitors in this
weather.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dixon was a privileged person; she had been
in command at Anselm Manor long before Warren
Courtly's mother died, and Irene declined to
have her removed, although her husband would
have been pleased to see the back of her.</p>

<p class="indent">Martha Dixon had a strong affection for Irene,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
although she would not abate a jot of her sternness
or abrupt manner under any consideration.
She also knew that Warren Courtly had been
anything but a saint before he married, but that
was none of her business.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose this is a gentle hint that I ought
not to be riding about this weather?&quot; said
Irene, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">Martha Dixon smiled back at her mistress
and said, in a soft tone&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you take care of yourself it will do you no
harm, and I know it's precious lonely at the
Manor. How did you find the Squire?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He looks wonderfully well, but it was a bad
night for him last night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then he remembers; he has forgotten
nothing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And never will. He thinks Ulick will come
back on the anniversary of the night he left
home, and he has steeled himself to wait another
year,&quot; said Irene.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That minx Janet is at the bottom of it all.
A regular little flirt; I have no patience with
'em,&quot; said Martha.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor Janet, she has suffered for her wrongdoing,
perhaps she is not to blame.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Ulick ought to have packed her off somewhere
and remained at home,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was too much of a man to do that,&quot; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
Irene. &quot;Do you know, Dixon, I met Eli as I
came here, and his faith in Ulick is as strong as
ever?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It does him credit, but he knows different
in his heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are mistaken; he believes Ulick is
not guilty of wronging his daughter, I am
sure of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish it would come true,&quot; said Martha.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must go now,&quot; said Irene. &quot;Please order
my horse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This being done, Martha Dixon fixed the
picture firmly on Irene's back, and fastened the
straps.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Squire will be pleased with that; it
was Mr. Ulick's favourite horse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe that is why he was glad when I
chose Random,&quot; said Irene, as she walked to
the door and quickly mounted Rupert.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If any letters come, shall I send them to
Hazelwell?&quot; asked Martha.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; replied Irene; then added quickly, as
she thought of the mysterious Felix Hoffman,
&quot;on second thoughts, perhaps you had better
do so, but I may ride over again in a day or two.
Mr. Courtly writes that he will not be back for a
week.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She rode quickly away, and Martha Dixon
watched her until she was out of sight.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>&quot;I have nothing to say against Mr. Warren,&quot;
muttered Martha, as she shut the door, &quot;but
I wish Mr. Ulick had not got into a mess. She'd
have been happier with him, although I say
it, as shouldn't.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CV" id="CV"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>HONEYSUCKLE'S FOAL.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was New Year's Eve, and Eli Todd was passing
through a series of varying emotions. A stranger
watching him might, with considerable excuse,
have put him down as a lunatic. No sooner was
he comfortably seated in his armchair by the cosy
fire than he jumped up again suddenly, seized
his hat, and dashed out into the wintry night.</p>

<p class="indent">After a quarter of an hour's absence he returned,
settled down again, commenced to doze
and, waking with a start, rushed out of the house
in the same erratic manner as before.</p>

<p class="indent">The cause of these proceedings on the part of
Eli was the mare, Honeysuckle. Never was a
man placed in such a predicament, all on account
of a mare, as Eli Todd on this occasion. It
wanted four hours to midnight, and every
moment the studmaster expected Honeysuckle's
foal would come forth into the cold and heartless
world an hour or two before the New Year. It
was enough to drive him to despair. This would
in all probability be Honeysuckle's last foal, but
the Squire had already made up his mind that
&quot;what's last is best.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>Blissfully ignorant was the Squire of the throes
of anxiety his trusty servant was enduring. It
was his firm belief that Honeysuckle would not
foal until the middle of January at the earliest,
and Eli had not undeceived him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do wish you would keep still and not worry
yourself,&quot; said Mrs. Marley. &quot;It can do no good,
the mare will get on quite as well without you;
leave it to nature.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Much you know about it,&quot; grumbled Eli.
&quot;Leaving it to nature is all very well, but you
ought to know that nature requires a little
assistance at times.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You never take advice,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do when it is good,&quot; was the effectual
reply.</p>

<p class="indent">Again Eli Todd opened the door, and a cold
blast struck him in the face. A light was burning
in Honeysuckle's box across the yard, and he
plodded through the snow to it.</p>

<p class="indent">His head man was inside sitting in a chair,
looking drowsy, and nodding.</p>

<p class="indent">Eli thought he had better go to bed, and said
he would take his place.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll call you if I want you,&quot; he said, and the
man thanked him as he went out.</p>

<p class="indent">Eli sat in the chair watching the old mare and
frequently looking at his watch. He had never
wished time to fly so rapidly before.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>Honeysuckle was restless, and from time to
time looked at him with her big, soft eyes in a
most pathetic way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can't do anything for you, old girl,&quot; he said.
&quot;But you can oblige me very much by staving
off the great event until the clock has struck
twelve. After that the sooner you are over your
trouble the better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Another half hour passed, and still found Eli
wakeful and on guard.</p>

<p class="indent">A slight noise outside aroused him, and he
listened attentively. &quot;It sounded like a man
walking, perhaps Joe has come back. I know he
is as anxious as I am about her,&quot; muttered Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">A knock on the door made him start, and he
said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who's there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No answer. It was mysterious at this hour
of the night.</p>

<p class="indent">He asked the question again, and the reply
was another rap.</p>

<p class="indent">Picking up his stick, he cautiously opened the
door and peered out. He saw a man, muffled up;
standing a yard or two away. Something about
the figure seemed familiar to him, and a peculiar
sensation passed through his body, making his
pulses tingle with anticipation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who are you, and what are you doing here?&quot;
he asked.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>&quot;Have you forgotten me, Eli?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The studmaster started back, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My God, it's Mr. Ulick!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, it's me, none other; may I come in?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For answer Eli dropped his stick, took him by
both hands, and dragged him into the box.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick Maynard unbuttoned his coat and unwound
the scarf around his neck. He was a tall,
handsome man, with a clear, open countenance.
It was the face of a man to be trusted, if ever
there was one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad to see you, but it's a strange time
to come,&quot; said Eli. &quot;Are you going up to the
house?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; was the emphatic reply. &quot;I shall
never go back to Hazelwell until my father asks
my pardon for the insult he put upon me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don't know how he has suffered since
you left,&quot; said Eli. &quot;He sat up all night on
Tuesday. You know what date it was?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; I left home on that night two years
ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Mrs. Courtly came over from the Manor
and stayed with him,&quot; said Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Irene,&quot; he said softly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and she told me the Squire would be
a young man again if you came back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do they still believe I wronged your
daughter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>Eli made no reply, he thought it better to
keep silent, for he would not tell a lie or deceive
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see,&quot; said Ulick, bitterly. &quot;I am still the
black sheep, a disgrace to the name. And you,
what do you think?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No need to ask me, Mr. Ulick. You know
what I think. I never believed you guilty, and
I never will, no, not even if Janet accused you,
because she would be forced to it by the man
who led her astray,&quot; said Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick took his hand and shook it heartily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, Eli,&quot; he said. &quot;I give you my
solemn word I did not wrong Janet. We may
have flirted a trifle, as a man will do with a pretty
girl, but I never injured her by word or deed.
Is she at home still?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Eli looked at him curiously. He evidently
had no idea Janet left her home the same night
he went away from Hazelwell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My girl has been away from me for two
years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was Ulick's turn to look surprised.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You thought it better to send her away, no
doubt?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not send her away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She left her home, ran away from you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's what happened.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When did she go?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>&quot;The same night you did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good heavens! No wonder my father still
believes me guilty. No doubt he thinks I went
with her,&quot; said Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He came to my house in a towering passion
the morning after she left, and when he found
out she had gone he was very bitter against you
both. He said words he ought not to have said,
but I am sure he repented them afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you heard anything of her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; replied Eli. &quot;Not a line from her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder who took her away? I'd give a
good deal to find out,&quot; said Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And so would I. She must be in London,
I think; it is a good place to hide in,&quot; said Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I find. A man can bury himself in
London without much fear of recognition.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you been in London since you left
Hazelwell?&quot; asked Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Most of the time. I very seldom came across
anyone I know. You see, I have money of my
own, independent of my father, so it enables me
to live comfortably.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what has brought you down here?&quot;
asked Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Curiosity, a desire to see the old place, call
it what you will. I wanted to have a chat
with you, and hear how my father was going
on,&quot; said Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>&quot;You had better go and see him. I am sure
he has suffered enough by your absence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And do you not think I have suffered?
And it makes it none the easier to bear because
it is unjust. Have you ever suspected any one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean about Janet?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would rather not say. I have no proof,
and if I am right it would cause even more
trouble than the suspicion about you did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you have some idea who the man is?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have, but we will not talk of that. If
everything comes to light, well and good, but
I am not going to be the one to cause more
unhappiness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You ought to tell me. I have a right to
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Granted, but you must forgive me if I
decline to say anything. This much I may tell
you, that if what I suspect is true it will bring
shame and disgrace upon someone who is very
dear to you,&quot; said Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick was astonished, and wondered if Eli
really had any grounds for suspicion. He would
think the matter over on his return to London;
it might possibly afford him some clue. If he
found out the real culprit he would be able to
judge what was best to be done. It was no use
questioning Eli further.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>&quot;Old Honeysuckle looks in rather a bad way,&quot;
he said, changing the subject, for which Eli was
very thankful.</p>

<p class="indent">Eli explained the situation to him, and Ulick,
looking at his watch, said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It only wants half an hour to midnight;
we have been talking a long time. I'll stay
with you and see it through. There is no danger
of the Squire suddenly coming down?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at this hour, I am glad to say. He
thinks there is no cause for anxiety. But will
you not come into the house? Mrs. Marley has
gone to bed, and we shall not be disturbed,&quot; said
Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us remain here until it is all over,&quot;
replied Ulick, and he sat down on the straw.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take this chair,&quot; said Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I prefer to be here, it is more comfortable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was a quiet night, and the light wind was
blowing from the village of Helton.</p>

<p class="indent">Honeysuckle was in considerable pain, and
they both watched her with anxious eyes,
knowing what a vast difference a few minutes
would make.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There's the church clock at Helton striking,&quot;
said Eli, as he opened the door of the box. He
gave a sigh of relief when the last stroke of
twelve came. The bells pealed forth a welcome
to the New Year, and the old year, with all its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
joys and sorrows, was gone for ever. What
would the New Year bring forth?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This was a curious way of seeing the Old
Year out and the New Year in,&quot; said Ulick,
smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">A quarter of an hour after midnight Honeysuckle's
troubles were over, and a fine colt foal
had come into the world almost at the sound
of the church bells.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We must make a note of this,&quot; said Eli,
putting down the date and hour of foaling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall not forget it,&quot; said Ulick. &quot;If there
happened to be any dispute my father would be
rather surprised if I was called as a witness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go across to my cottage,&quot; said Eli. &quot;I'll
ring Joe up, there is no occasion for you to see
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will wait outside the gate for you,&quot; said
Ulick, as he went across the yard.</p>

<p class="indent">Leaving Joe in charge, with strict injunctions
to call him at once if wanted, Eli hurried after
Ulick, and, opening the door, led him into the
room where he had an interview with Janet the
night they both left home.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick sank into a chair tired out, and soon
fell asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">Eli stood looking on him with a sorrowful
expression on his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish he'd go and see the Squire,&quot; he said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
to himself. &quot;There would be a reconciliation
between them, I am sure; but Mr. Ulick is as
proud and stubborn as his father when he knows
he is in the right. He looks a trifle older, but
not much. It's a blessing he does not lack for
money. I wonder what he has been doing with
his time, racing probably&mdash;it runs in the blood.
He never was a great gambler; I hope he has not
taken to it to kill time and drown his feelings.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Eli was accustomed to night watches, and did
not go to sleep. He locked the door so that
no one could intrude, and about four o'clock he
roused Ulick and asked him to have something
to eat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The cold and long walk made me drowsy,&quot;
he said, with a yawn. &quot;I acknowledge to feeling
hungry, likewise thirsty. If you have any cold
meat; that will do, and some of your noted
beer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose you wish to keep this visit a
secret?&quot; asked Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; it has done me good to run down to
the old place. I shall try and find out Janet
when I get back to town. You have no objection,
I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the contrary, I hope you will find her.
If you do, try and induce her to come home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll bring her myself if I can,&quot; said Ulick.
&quot;They think we went away together, so we may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
as well return together; but she will have to
give me the name of the man who has caused
all the trouble.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He ate ravenously, and Eli was pleased to
see him make such a hearty meal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must be going now,&quot; said Ulick. &quot;You
will not tell anyone I have been here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. Which way are you going?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall walk to Haydon Station and catch
the early train to London. I got out there; there
is a new station-master, he does not know me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's more than ten miles,&quot; said Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will do me good. I have not done much
country walking lately.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you leave me your address in town,
I will take care no one sees it?&quot; asked Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick wrote on a sheet in his pocket-book,
and handed it to Eli, saying, &quot;That address will
always find me, no matter whether I am in
London or otherwise. I always have my letters
sent on, even if I am only away for a few days
at a race meeting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you go in for racing?&quot; said Eli,
smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I have attended many meetings since
I left Hazelwell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you bet?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick laughed, as he replied, &quot;Sometimes, but
I know too much about it to risk large sums.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
Between you and me, Eli, I own a couple of
horses, one I daresay you have heard of, his name
is the Saint.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You own the Saint!&quot; exclaimed Eli; &quot;why,
he was about the best of the two-year-olds last
season.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was, and he will not be far off being the
best of the three-year-olds this season. I bought
him for a reasonable figure. Of course, you
know his breeding: by Father Confessor out of
Hilda. I hope to win some good races with
him. He runs in the assumed name of Mr.
Lanark. I hope when brighter days have
dawned he will come to Hazelwell. It would
rather surprise the Squire if he knew he belonged
to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick went into the hall and put on his
coat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We might ride part of the way,&quot; said Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's better for me to walk,&quot; replied Ulick,
and added, &quot;I will let you know if I hear anything
of Janet, and will try and persuade her to come
home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, Mr. Ulick, and if you do come
across her, tell her home is the best place for
her, and that I shall never remind her of what
has happened.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you still have faith in me?&quot; asked
Ulick, smiling, as he shook hands.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>&quot;Yes, and always shall have, as I told you
before,&quot; said Eli, who watched him until he
disappeared in the darkness, and wondered at
the strange chance that brought him to Hazelwell
the night Honeysuckle's foal was born.</p>

<h2><a name="CVI" id="CVI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>A WILY YOUNG MAN.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a small, but comfortably-furnished house at
Feltham, lived Mrs. Hoffman and her son, Felix.
She was not a widow, but her husband had left
her some years before.  At that time her son
was seventeen, now he was five-and-twenty, and
a sore trial and trouble to her. Felix Hoffman
was one of many men who prefer idleness to
work, and he took good care not to find any suitable
employment. It troubled his mother that
he was seldom short of money. How did he
obtain it? Not by work of any kind, of that
she was certain. Once or twice she questioned
him as to how he made sufficient to supply his
wants, which were by no means few or inexpensive,
but he always flew into a passion on
such occasions, and his attitude became so
threatening that she forebore to make further
inquiries.</p>

<p class="indent">Felix Hoffman was not bad looking. He had
a Jewish cast of features, black curly hair, and
a fierce moustache of the same colour. His eyes
were dark brown, shifty and uncertain, and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
he conversed he seldom looked his companion
in the face.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not resemble his mother in the least; she
was English, and married Milas Hoffman when
quite a girl. Had she been more experienced
in the ways of the world he would have had but
little chance of winning her. A few months after
their marriage she found out her mistake. Milas
Hoffman called himself a travelling jeweller.
He certainly went about the country with a
case packed with glittering ornaments, which
he disposed of on most advantageous terms to
servant girls, young grooms, and others of the
same class in different countries. His profits
were large, and he made a very fair income out
of the gullibility of his customers. He became
more daring in his transactions, and at last
came within the grasp of the law. Not wishing
to face the charges of swindling brought against
him, he left England, and his wife had never
heard of him since. She did not mourn over
his desertion. She had sufficient money by her
to carry on for a time, and she fixed her hopes
upon her son Felix. They were doomed to be
rudely shattered when he coolly told her there
were plenty of ways of making money without
working for it. What those ways were
he failed to tell her, but it saddened her
to see that he was right, and he drew supplies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
from sources she felt sure she could not
approve of.</p>

<p class="indent">Felix Hoffman met many men in London in
very different positions in life to himself. He
was a frequenter of racecourses, one of the
undesirables whose presence gives the sport a
bad name, and its enemies a handle wherewith
to pump obloquy upon all connected with it,
the just and the unjust. At first he was a bookmaker's
tout, and rushed about the ring watching
the fluctuation of the odds, scenting out stable
commissions and repeating the same to his
employer with lightning speed. It was seldom
the bookmaker was let in for a big bet &quot;over the
odds&quot; when Felix Hoffman was hovering about
with hawk-like keenness. The said bookmaker,
whose sham diamonds were the envy of the
uninitiated, became so impressed with the fertile
resources of Felix Hoffman that he actually
ventured to take him into partnership &quot;in the
book.&quot; This was a grave mistake, for in a very
short time the versatile Felix had transformed
the firm, and his name alone figured on the bag
and tickets. The members of Tattersall's smiled;
many of them had seen these mysterious changes
before and knew what it meant. Felix Hoffman,
in his turn, made a mistake. He handed over
the &quot;bag&quot; to two men he fancied he could trust,
and proceeded to back horses on his own account.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
He saw no reason why, with his skill in scenting
out commissions and spotting genuinely-backed
horses, he should not be able to lay the losers
and back the winners. Better men than Felix
had endeavoured to accomplish this feat before,
and come lamentably to grief, and he followed
them into the same quandary. It puzzled
Felix not a little to find out the cause of
his failure. He had not yet learned that to
be successful on the turf a man must be either
a backer or a layer, but not both, and in the
one capacity a good share of luck must be his
to succeed.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly was fond of racing, especially
&quot;chasing,&quot; and during the off-season he was
frequently seen at meetings round London.
Even the attractions of the hunting field could not,
on many occasions, lure him from the racecourse.
Irene knew he frequented such places, but she
had no idea of the extent of his gambling
transactions, or they would have appalled her.
She thought his statement that the Anselm
Manor estates required a good deal of looking
after was an excuse for his visits to London, but,
as a matter of fact, he was correct in his assertion.
Everything he could mortgage he did, and even
the Manor itself had sundry charges upon it,
which he found it difficult to meet. The racecourse
is a rare levelling ground, and men of very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
different types fraternise together with a freedom
never seen elsewhere. Warren Courtly had
noticed Felix Hoffman's energy in ferreting out
information, and on more than one occasion
had taken the trouble to find out whether he was
right or wrong. In this way he gathered that
his advice was generally good. He approached
him one day at Hurst Park, and asked his advice
about Milander in a hurdle race.</p>

<p class="indent">Felix Hoffman was not at all surprised at a
stranger speaking to him about such matters.
He eyed Warren Courtly over, and came to the
conclusion it would pay him to tell him all he
knew. As luck would have it, he did know
Milander was a very fair thing for the hurdle
race.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll make it worth your while if it wins,&quot;
said Warren.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What will you put me on?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will lay you the odds to a fiver.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Milander has a very good chance. Dyer rides
him, and he told me, bar accident, he would
win. I think you can back him for a good
stake.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Meet me here after the race,&quot; said Warren,
and walked out of the paddock into the ring.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's a real swell,&quot; thought Felix. &quot;He
may come in useful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Milander won comfortably, and started at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
remunerative odds of five to one. Warren
Courtly won a good stake, and handed Felix
&quot;a pony,&quot; the winnings on the five pounds
he put on for him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'd give Dyer something, sir, if I were you,&quot;
said Felix. &quot;He's not a bad sort, and generally
tells me when he has a chance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give him this,&quot; said Warren, handing Felix
a ten-pound note.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I see you again, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am often at these meetings. If you know
anything, come and tell me, and I will see you are
a gainer thereby.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was in this way Warren Courtly became
acquainted with Felix Hoffman, who later on
helped him in another way, which did not redound
to his credit, and which eventually gave that
wily young man a hold over the master of Anselm
Court.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Hoffman was surprised one day when her
son brought Warren Courtly down to Feltham.
She wondered how Felix became acquainted
with him, and still more why his friend condescended
to associate with him. She knew her
son was not at all a desirable companion for a
man of Warren Courtly's stamp.</p>

<p class="indent">Felix introduced him as Mr. Warren. &quot;A
gentleman I have frequently met on the racecourse,
mother; he wishes to consult you on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
private matter, and I hope you will agree to his
request.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Hoffman was surprised, but expressed
her readiness to hear what he had to tell her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is rather a delicate matter,&quot; commenced
Warren, when Felix left the room; &quot;the fact of
the matter is, I am anxious to find a comfortable
home for my wife until my father can be informed
of our marriage. He is very much set against
it because the lady is hardly in the same set as
ourselves. I have married for love, but that
is no reason why I should forfeit the many
advantages I now have, and which I should
certainly lose if my father found out I was married.
My wife is young and pretty, and would, I am
sure, cause very little trouble in a house. I
asked your son if he knew of any place where I
could leave her, in or near London, and he said
he had no doubt his mother would be pleased
to have her, and he was quite certain would
make her comfortable. If you have no objection,
Mrs. Hoffman, I should like my wife to have
rooms here, and I am sure I could rely upon you
to treat her kindly, and be a companion to her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Hoffman was not at all displeased at this
proposal, but she foresaw one danger, and that
was Felix. She knew him to be utterly unscrupulous,
and feared his influence over a young
married woman living apart from her husband,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
for that was what it meant. However, she
would take very good care he had no opportunities
of making himself objectionable to
her.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly noticed the hesitation, and
said, &quot;I do not think there will be any trouble
over the terms. I know very little about these
matters, but if you will make a suggestion I
will consider it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Hoffman had no intention of asking
too little. Her experience of life had taught
her much, and she had her doubts as to
the truth of the story she had heard. Still,
that was none of her business, and she meant
to do her duty by the girl when she came to
her house.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would three guineas a week be too much,
sir? There may be a few extras, which I
suppose you would not mind paying for?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is reasonable,&quot; said Warren, who had
expected a higher figure, &quot;and I hope you will
do all in your power to make Mrs. Warren comfortable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can safely promise you that, and that I shall
be very pleased to have someone in the house,
for my son is generally away from home. When
may we expect you, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Warren named the date, and she replied&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is quite close to Christmas. Shall you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
stay here during that week, if so I will prepare
for you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry to say I shall be away; my father
will expect me to be at home with the rest of
the family,&quot; said Warren.</p>

<p class="indent">In due course, Warren arrived at Mrs.
Hoffman's house at Feltham with Janet Todd,
and she had been there two years living under
the name of Mrs. Warren.</p>

<p class="indent">Seven or eight months after he had found
Janet a home with Mrs. Hoffman, Warren married
Irene Carstone, and considered he had done his
duty by Janet, and that this discreditable action
in his life was closed.</p>

<p class="indent">It troubled him when he heard Ulick Maynard
was looked upon as the wrongdoer, but he
had not the manliness or the courage to confess,
and thus place the blame upon his own
shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a strange coincidence, he thought,
that the Squire should have made this accusation
against Ulick on the same night he had planned
to take Janet away. He had not much difficulty
in persuading her to go, and he knew she was
fully convinced he would marry her. This did
not trouble him much, his anxiety was to get
her away from Hazelwell, because he had at
that time made up his mind to marry Irene, if
she would have him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>Fate played into his hands, and worked everything
smoothly for him. When he heard from
Janet that Ulick had been at her father's, and
told her the Squire had accused him of being
the cause of her misfortune, Warren was
astounded. He saw at once how Janet's flight
would confirm the Squire's charge, and that
everyone would believe she had left her home
with Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did he say to you?&quot; asked Warren.</p>

<p class="indent">Janet hung her head, and her cheeks became
crimson.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me what he said,&quot; Warren asked,
sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was very angry, and said I deserved
to be thrashed for bringing disgrace upon my
father; as for myself, it was no more than I
deserved. He asked me who had got me into
trouble.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You did not tell him?&quot; said Warren,
anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How can you ask such a question? Of
course I did not tell him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's a good girl, Janet; you must always
keep our secret.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That depends upon how you treat me,&quot; she
replied, and at this answer Warren Courtly
commenced to see it might not be all plain sailing
with her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>&quot;Did Mr. Maynard tell you he was suspected
of being the cause of your trouble?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and I offered to write to his father
and tell him it was untrue, but he was very
angry and forbade me doing so, saying his
father ought to have known him better, and
that he must find out the truth for himself,&quot;
said Janet.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren was relieved at this. He knew Ulick
Maynard had a proud, stubborn disposition, and
that his father's suspicions would sting him to
the quick. It was not at all likely he would
ask Janet to prove his innocence, and when
she was at Feltham he would have but little
chance of finding her, even if he changed his
mind.</p>

<p class="indent">They arrived in London, and went from
Waterloo to Feltham.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Remember, you are Mrs. Warren,&quot; he said,
&quot;and do not let anyone find out where you
come from. Mrs. Hoffman you will like, but her
son is a scamp, and you will do well to avoid
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Hoffman soon grew very fond of Janet,
and the girl reciprocated the motherly feelings
thus shown. She was not unhappy, but she
would have been more contented had Warren
allowed her to write to her father and tell him
all was well with her. This, however, he strictly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
forbade; he did not wish her to have any communication
with Hazelwell.</p>

<p class="indent">The first serious quarrel took place when
Warren told her he was to marry Irene
Carstone.</p>

<p class="indent">Janet wept, and then flew into a rage, vowing
she would write to her father, the Squire, and
Irene, and confess all. He dare not leave her
for a week, and during that time he used all his
persuasive powers to calm her, and at times
resorted to threats, which she only laughed at.</p>

<p class="indent">Eventually he took Mrs. Hoffman into his
confidence, and discovered that she had suspected
the truth all along.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish you would use your influence with
her,&quot; he said; &quot;I am quite willing to make her a
good allowance, and also settle a sum of money
upon her, provided she holds her tongue.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Hoffman promised she would do all that
lay in her power to bring Janet to a proper frame
of mind. She really liked her, and thought
she was far happier as she was than if she had
married Warren.</p>

<p class="indent">She succeeded in her endeavour, but Janet
was mercenary when it came to terms with
Mr. Courtly. She was determined to have
adequate remuneration for all she had lost, and
the deception he had practised on her. He
grumbled at her demands, but she was firm,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
and as there was no other way out of the
difficulty, except exposure, he gave in.</p>

<p class="indent">Janet knew her power over him, and his
marriage with Irene materially increased it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder what she would do if she knew
all?&quot; thought Janet.</p>

<h2><a name="CVII" id="CVII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>SELLING HIS HERITAGE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was hardly to be expected that Janet should
remain under the roof of Mrs. Hoffman without
attracting the attention of her unscrupulous
son, and at last Felix Hoffman annoyed her so
persistently that his mother gave him to understand
if he did not desist he would be forbidden
the house. Janet hated the sight of him, and
seldom answered his questions. This annoyed
him, and offended his pride, of which he possessed
a ridiculous quantity. One day, when Janet
was out, he came across a letter she had carelessly
left on her table, and without scruple picked it
up and read it. The contents did not afford
him much gratification, but the heading to the
paper gave food for reflection. Anselm Manor,
Rushshire, sounded well, and the letter was
signed Warren.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Warren what? He must have another
name,&quot; thought Felix. &quot;I should like to know
what it is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He set to work to find out, and was not long
before he succeeded. Warren Courtly was well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
known amongst sporting men, and Felix soon
discovered who and what he was.</p>

<p class="indent">He chuckled to himself as he thought what a
commotion it would cause if Mrs. Courtly knew
about Janet Todd's connection with her husband.
He foresaw a profitable harvest from this source,
but had no intention of putting Warren Courtly
on his guard at present.</p>

<p class="indent">He had written many begging letters in the
course of his life, and several of them had proved
effective. It occurred to him it would be a
neat stroke of business to write to Mrs. Courtly
for assistance, and after several attempts he
decided to dispatch the one already alluded
to.</p>

<p class="indent">It reached Irene safely, with the result that
Felix was enriched by five pounds. He was quite
proud of this achievement, for he had doubts
as to the success of his missive.</p>

<p class="indent">He wrote back thanking her, and repeating
that he would refund the money at some future
date.</p>

<p class="indent">This was how Irene came to have a knowledge
of Felix Hoffman. His reply was sent on to
Hazelwell, and she decided to show both letters
to the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope you will not think me very foolish,&quot;
she said, as she handed him the letters; &quot;you
will gather from them what has taken place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>Redmond Maynard read them, and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This man, whoever he is, must be a clever
rogue, it is a form of begging-letter writing I have
never seen before. I do not blame you for
sending the money, although had you consulted
me I should have felt more inclined to hand
over the matter to the police. You must not
send him any more money,&quot; said the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think he will write for more?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Most decidedly, especially as his first letter
was such a success.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had thought of going to Feltham the next
time I am in London, and finding out where he
lives and the kind of man he is,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must not do anything of the kind.
There is no telling where he is; at any rate,
you must not venture there alone,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is merely from a desire to gratify my
curiosity that I wish to go. I am sure no
harm will come of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire shook his head, as he replied&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The letter has cost you five pounds, let the
matter drop and think no more about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Feltham is not far from Kempton Park,&quot;
said Irene. &quot;I wonder if Warren knows anything
about the place?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Probably. Ask him when he returns home,&quot;
said the Squire. &quot;By the way, Irene, I had
almost forgotten it is New Year's Day. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
are not a very jolly household for the occasion,
but we must not commence another year with
gloomy thoughts and melancholy countenances.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope this year will bring Ulick home
again,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So do I, with all my heart,&quot; said the Squire.
&quot;There's Eli coming up the walk, I wonder
what he wants.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I tell Bob to send him in when he
arrives?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, do, Irene.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Eli Todd came into the room, and wished
them a cheery Happy New Year. &quot;We have
made a good start at the stud, although I had a
terribly anxious time of it,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Made a good start, what do you mean?&quot;
said the Squire. &quot;There are no foals yet?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only one,&quot; replied Eli, smiling, &quot;and he was
precious near being born before midnight. As
luck would have it, he came into the world a
quarter of an hour after, so that is all right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But there was no mare due to foal so early,&quot;
remarked the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only old Honeysuckle,&quot; said Eli, with a
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean to tell me the old mare has a
foal? I was certain it would be the middle of
the month before that event came off,&quot; said the
Squire.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>&quot;I knew you were wrong, but I did not contradict
you,&quot; replied Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then if you knew I was wrong, it was your
business to tell me, and you ought to have done
so,&quot; said the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">Eli was a privileged servant, and although
always respectful to the Squire, occasionally
answered him bluntly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not an easy matter to contradict you,
Squire; you generally like to have your own
way,&quot; said Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene laughed, and said she must certainly
side with him in his remark.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is rather hard upon me,&quot; replied the
Squire. &quot;I had no idea I was so obstinate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but you are,&quot; laughed Irene, &quot;and once
you have made up your mind you stick to it
through thick and thin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is about a correct summing up of the
situation,&quot; said Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What sort of a youngster is it?&quot; asked the
Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very promising, so far as I can judge at this
stage; he ought to make a good one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do let us go and see him,&quot; said Irene.</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire walked to the window and looked
out. The snow still lay deep upon the ground,
but it was hard and crisp, and afforded good
walking.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>&quot;I think we may venture,&quot; he said. &quot;Will
you come, Irene?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With pleasure, I will not be more than a
few minutes putting on my things.&quot; She left
the room, and returned enveloped in a seal-skin
jacket, trimmed with heavy sable, and a toque
to match. She looked very attractive, and the
Squire glanced at her admiringly. Eli Todd
thought he had never seen a prettier woman,
and wondered how Ulick could have been so
foolish as to leave the way clear for Warren
Courtly to win her.</p>

<p class="indent">They thoroughly enjoyed the walk in the
brisk, frosty air, and when they arrived at the
stud farm Eli took them to Honeysuckle's box.</p>

<p class="indent">He quietly opened the door, and, stepping
inside, they saw a pretty sight. The mare was
standing sideways to them, and as they entered
the foal looked at them with big, inquiring eyes.
He sidled up close to his mother, and playfully
pushed her with his nose. He was a well-made
colt, long on the leg, and with a beautiful
head and well-shaped body.</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire eyed him critically for several
minutes, and then said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He ought to make a good one, there is plenty
of room for him to fill out and develop. I am glad
Honeysuckle has thrown such a good one, it
will probably be her last.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>&quot;I thought you would like him,&quot; said Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene went up to him and patted him gently.
The colt was not at all alarmed, and sniffed at
her jacket and fur with evident relish.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's a dear little fellow,&quot; she said, &quot;and I
hope he will win a good race or two for you. I
should like to see him win.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may have that pleasure next year,&quot;
said the Squire, &quot;that is if he goes on all right;
so many promising foals turn out badly, one never
knows what may happen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bersak put his head in the door, and the colt
started back in alarm. It was his first introduction
to another animal, and he evidently
regarded Bersak as some wild savage beast of
prey. Honeysuckle turned round, and looked
straight at the intruder, but she and Bersak were
friends and had met many times before.</p>

<p class="indent">Eli thought of the scene the previous night,
and wished he could tell the Squire he had seen
Ulick. He had given his word not to mention
the visit, and therefore his lips were sealed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will walk through the plantation on the
way home,&quot; said the Squire, &quot;it is a short cut,
and I feel I shall be ready for luncheon when we
get in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They set off at a brisk pace, Bersak following
at their heels. It was a pleasant walk, and hares
and rabbits frequently ran across their path,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
while the pheasants strutted about proudly,
their brilliant plumage affording a sharp contrast
to the snow.</p>

<p class="indent">After luncheon the Squire had his usual nap,
and Irene looked over the various papers and
magazines.</p>

<p class="indent">A paragraph caught her eye, and she read it
with feelings of wonder and amazement. It
was to the effect that Mr. Warren Courtly, of
Anselm Manor, had disposed of Holme Farm
for the sum of ten thousand pounds, and this
was instanced as another proof of the decreased
value of land.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sold the Holme Farm, there must be some
mistake!&quot; thought Irene, and read the paragraph
again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He never mentioned anything about it to
me, and I know of no reason why he should sell
it. I wonder where these rumours originate;
they have no business to insert them in the
paper until they ascertain whether they are
correct.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was troubled over it, although she did not
believe it to be true. The Holme Farm was one
of the best on the Anselm estate, and even if
Warren had been compelled to sell it, she thought
he might have given the Squire the first refusal.
She failed to understand the meaning of it, and
was still puzzling over the matter when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
Squire awoke and looked at her through his
half-closed eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">He saw something had disturbed her, and,
sitting up in his chair, inquired the cause.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is an announcement in the paper I
cannot understand,&quot; she said. &quot;This is it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He read the paragraph and said, &quot;What an
abominable statement to make. It must be
some other farm of that name, and Warren's
name has been inadvertently inserted as that
of the owner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at it again, and saw it was an
announcement made by the auctioneers who sold
the property. This made the matter more serious,
the sellers would not be likely to make such a
mistake.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Warren would never have sold it without
telling me he was about to do so,&quot; said Irene.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has done a very foolish thing if he has
sold it,&quot; said the Squire. &quot;He cannot possibly
be short of money with the income he has.
Ten thousand pounds is a ridiculous sum for
the Holme Farm, it ought to be worth five
thousand more at least. He will explain what
it all means when he returns home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Notwithstanding he spoke confidently, the
Squire had his misgivings. He had heard vague
rumours from his brother magistrates, when he
met them as chairman of the county bench and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
of the quarter sessions, that all was not well with
Warren Courtly. He paid very little attention
to the statements, treating them as so much idle
gossip, but they came home to him forcibly now.
He had heard that Warren Courtly had been
going the pace on the racecourse and gambling
heavily, but he thought Warren quite capable
of looking after himself. They passed a somewhat
quiet afternoon and evening, for the announcement
disturbed them both, and Irene
was anxious for the next morning to come, in
the hope it might bring her some explanation
from her husband.</p>

<p class="indent">It was quite true that Warren Courtly had sold
the Holme Farm for ten thousand pounds, and
the bulk of the money received from it went
to pay his debts. He was in no very enviable
frame of mind when he stepped into the Windsor
train at Waterloo on his way to Feltham to see
Janet. He was heartily sick and tired of her,
and of the deception he had to practise in connection
with her. Moreover, Janet was becoming
troublesome, and, what was still worse, homesick.
She was constantly imploring him to allow her
to return to her father, promising to keep his
secret and never to breathe a word about their
intimacy. Warren Courtly would not hear of
it. He knew of Eli Todd's great affection and
devotedness to Ulick, and felt certain he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
extract the truth from Janet if she lived with
him again. He had wronged Irene, and deceived
her, but he meant to shield her from the consequences
of his folly at any cost. She must
never know that he had been cowardly enough
to allow Ulick to lie under the ban of a false
accusation.</p>

<p class="indent">He left the train at Feltham, and walked to
Mrs. Hoffman's.</p>

<p class="indent">Janet shook hands with him as an ordinary
acquaintance; there was no love between
them now, whatever there had been a
couple of years ago. The more she saw of him
and learned his nature, the more she despised
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are looking well,&quot; he said, &quot;the world
is treating you better than me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it?&quot; she answered, carelessly. &quot;I am
very unhappy, I want to go home again.
I cannot rest until Mr. Ulick's name is
cleared. It is a shame he should suffer for
your fault.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My fault and yours,&quot; he said, angrily. &quot;You
always lay all the blame at my door.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And that is where it ought to be. I was a
fool ever to trust you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have done all I can for you, more than I
can afford.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed as she replied&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>&quot;That is nice talk for the owner of Anselm
Manor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is true nevertheless. I have sold the
Holme Farm to pay my debts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't believe it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Read that,&quot; he said, and handed her the
paper with an account of the sale.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ten thousand pounds!&quot; she exclaimed.
&quot;That is a lot of money. I am rather short of
cash, you must give me some.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You had twenty pounds last month.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I want twenty more now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You cannot have it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you must take the consequences,&quot;
she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What shall you do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pack up my things, go down to Helton, see
my father, and tell the truth,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You dare not, no one would believe your
story.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One person would, I am certain,&quot; she
answered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Probably, but I meant your wife,&quot; said
Janet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You dare not speak to her of such things,&quot;
he said, angrily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And why not? She has every right to
know the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>&quot;If I give you the money will you hold your
tongue?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, until I require more,&quot; was her reply.</p>

<p class="indent">He gave her twenty pounds, thankful to be
able to stave off the evil day, hoping in the
meantime to find some way out of his difficulties.</p>

<h2><a name="CVIII" id="CVIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>WARREN'S RETURN.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Warren Courtly</span> returned home during the
week, and Irene was at the Manor to receive
him. She did not welcome him with her usual
heartiness, and he expected there was something
wrong.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have been away a long time,&quot; she said.
&quot;I expected you home last week. Your business
must have been very important.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was,&quot; he replied, &quot;and I have not finished
it. I shall have to go to London again soon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will accompany you,&quot; she said; &quot;I have
not been to London for some time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As you wish. I shall be glad of your society.
Have you been staying with the Squire?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and we have managed to pass the time
pleasantly. I took him the picture of Random,
and he was delighted with it; he has it in his study.
We were very much surprised to see an announcement
in the paper that you had sold the Holme
Farm, but I suppose it is incorrect?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry to say it is correct. I had to
sell it, Irene, I was in difficulties.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>&quot;You, in difficulties!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;How
is that possible, you have a large income?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been gambling, and owed more than
I could pay. So I thought the best way would
be to sell Holme Farm and clear them all off.
I shall be more cautious next time, you may be
sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You might have told me how matters stood,&quot;
she said, reproachfully. &quot;And if you were
compelled to sell the Farm, why did you not
offer it to the Squire, he would have given you a
better price than that for it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had no idea he would buy it; he is always
grumbling about land, and saying it is no good
investing in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He said Holme Farm was worth five thousand
more than you accepted for it, and I believe
he would have given it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was angry with himself when he heard
this, but he knew the real reason he had not
offered it to the Squire was that he was ashamed
to do so. As he looked at Irene, he recognised
her beauty more clearly than he had ever done
before. He felt he was dealing her blow after
blow, and the worst was yet to come. It made
him desperate when he thought of Janet, and
the trouble she could cause. Why had he been
such a fool to fall into the toils of such a minx?
He hated her name, and it was sacrilege to think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
of her in the presence of Irene. As for Irene
she was depressed and uneasy at her husband's
statement. If he was compelled to sell the
Holme Farm, others might follow, and the
estate gradually dwindle down to small proportions.
It was not a bright prospect after
only eighteen months of married life. She saw
he was worried and troubled, and did not look
himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you feeling unwell?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because you do not look in your usual health;
if you have any trouble, Warren, I wish you
would confide in me, and I might possibly help
you. It will be far better for me to hear it
from you than from any outsiders, and you
know what gossips people are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He felt a strong impulse to tell her everything
even to confess his fault with Janet, and how he
had allowed suspicion to rest upon Ulick, but he
dare not do it. He knew she would never forgive
him, although she might condone his failings. If
an outsider made her acquainted with the fact
it would be far worse, but he must risk that.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have nothing to tell you,&quot; he said. &quot;It
troubled me to have to part with the farm, but I
saw no other way out of the difficulty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can quite understand that,&quot; she replied.
&quot;As it was necessary for you to do it, we will say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
no more about it; but I expect the Squire will
pull you over the coals,&quot; she added, with a
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">Next morning a thaw set in, and the pure
white landscape quickly changed to a dull,
leadened colour. The melting snow dripped from
the roof in a monotonous splash, the trees were
wet and dismal, and the ground was a mass of
sticky slush and mud. The sky was dark and
lowering, and the effect depressing.</p>

<p class="indent">They both felt the effects of the change at
breakfast time. Irene was naturally of a bright
disposition, and tried to cheer her husband's
drooping spirits, but with ill-success.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Honeysuckle had a colt foal half an hour
after midnight on New Year's Day,&quot; she said.
&quot;That was a slice of luck, and Eli had a very
anxious time until he was born.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What an extraordinary thing,&quot; he said.
&quot;The Squire would be pleased. What kind of
a colt is he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A good one I should say; we saw him the
same day, and he pleased both the Squire and
Eli.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must have a look at him,&quot; he replied;
then, glancing out of the window, went on:
&quot;There is nothing more miserable than a thaw;
I shall be glad when all the snow is gone, and there
is a chance of hunting again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>&quot;It will be a treat to be in the saddle after
such a long spell,&quot; she replied. Then, changing
the subject, she said, &quot;I had a peculiar letter
when you were away. I showed it to the Squire,
and he thought it was written by a clever rogue.
My impression was that the man was genuinely
in want of a small loan, but how he came to write
to me I do not know. Here is the letter and his
reply to my note.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly took it carelessly, but no
sooner did he see the handwriting than he hastily
turned to look at the signature, and when he
saw &quot;Felix Hoffman&quot; the letter fell upon the table
and he sank back into his chair, his face white
and drawn.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene was surprised and alarmed at the effect
it produced, and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the matter, Warren? Is it the letter
causes you anxiety? Do you know the man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He made no answer, but took the letter and
read it, wondering how it came about that Felix
Hoffman should have discovered who he was
and have the audacity to write to his wife.
Janet must have confided in him, that was the
only solution he arrived at, and he vowed she
should suffer for her betrayal. These brief
minutes, when his wife's eyes were upon him,
noting every change and movement, were the
worst he had ever spent in his life.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>&quot;Do you know the man?&quot; she asked, again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A racecourse sharper, a scoundrel, an unprincipled
blackguard,&quot; said Warren, savagely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then how is it you know him?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We meet many undesirable people on racecourses;
he is one of the most undesirable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you have no necessity to associate with
such men.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are useful sometimes; even the man
Hoffman has given me good information.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If he is such a man as you describe, I should
be ashamed to be seen with him. How dare he
write to me?&quot; she said, angrily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was a gross piece of impertinence,&quot; replied
Warren, &quot;for which he shall pay dearly. Leave
me to deal with him, Irene.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He ought to be thrashed,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He shall be, and he will not forget it as long
as he lives. You were very foolish to send the
money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Squire said the letter ought to have been
handed over to the police.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was a blessing it was not,&quot; thought
Warren.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a rapid thaw, and at the end of the
week not a vestige of snow was to be seen, except
in some shaded corner where the sunlight never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
crept in, and where the overhanging cavern
kept off the dripping water.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly rode over to Hazelwell, and
did not receive a very hearty greeting from
Redmond Maynard.</p>

<p class="indent">They looked at Honeysuckle's foal, and Warren
pronounced it one of the best she had had.
Eli Todd, he fancied, treated him in a somewhat
off-hand manner. Surely he did not suspect
anything, he could not unless Janet had written
to him.</p>

<p class="indent">Everything jarred upon him, his nerves were
disordered, and he felt irritable and out of sorts.
He dreaded an exposure, and felt it was gradually
coming. He knew what the Squire's wrath would
be when he found out Ulick had been unjustly
suspected, as he must do sooner or later.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell him all and get rid of the burden,&quot;
whispered conscience. He dare not, and yet it
would have been the best way out of the sea of
trouble into which he was floundering.</p>

<p class="indent">In the Squire's study hung the painting of
Random, and he pointed it out to Warren with
pride, and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Irene has done it splendidly; it is lifelike.
I never saw a picture of a horse more natural.
You ought to be proud of your wife, she does
many things, and does them all well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am proud of her,&quot; said Warren, in a half-hearted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
tone that irritated the Squire, who of
late had been constantly blaming himself for
being the cause of Irene throwing herself away
upon Warren Courtly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is the best woman I know, and her heart
is in the right place. Confound it, Warren, you
have no right to leave her alone as you do, it is
not fair to her. Why don't you take her up to
London, if you really have to go to town so
often?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will next time,&quot; said Warren, lamely.
He seemed at a loss for words, and the Squire
thought he had a shame-faced look.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's been up to some devilment, I'm sure
of it,&quot; he thought. &quot;By Jupiter, if he's done
anything to trouble Irene's peace of mind he'll
find he has me to reckon with.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your journey to London does not seem to
have benefited you much,&quot; said the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hate town,&quot; grumbled Warren.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why go there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because it is so deuced dull at the Manor
when there is no hunting on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The selfish beggar,&quot; thought the Squire,
as he said aloud, &quot;And do you not think it is
dull for Irene when you are away?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is generally at Hazelwell, and you are
excellent company, Squire.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I? Much you know about it. Let me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
tell you if it had not been for Irene I should have
had a fit of the blues that would have got the
best of me a few nights back. Perhaps you can
imagine what night it was?&quot; said the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I cannot; but, anyway, I am glad she
was here to cheer you up. I told her to ride
over and see you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you forgotten what happened over
two years ago?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He could not pretend to misunderstand,
although they were getting on rather dangerous
ground.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean the night Ulick left home?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and I sat up all that night, and I shall
sit up every night when it comes round, year by
year, until he returns home again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you have changed your mind?&quot; said
Warren.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have forgiven him, but he must prove
his innocence, and I am beginning to believe
he will. Something tells me he will,&quot; he said,
as he looked at Warren in a way that made him
feel very uncomfortable, and yet he knew nothing
had been found out&mdash;at present.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ulick was hardly the sort of man one would
have expected to get into such a mess,&quot; said
Warren.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are right; that is what I cannot understand,&quot;
replied the Squire, thinking at the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
time Warren Courtly was a much more likely
man to do so.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Irene told me you thought I was foolish to
accept ten thousand for the Holme Farm,&quot; said
Warren.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I still think so. Why did you sell it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had to, I owed a lot of money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Betting?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mostly, but I am out of the mire now, and
intend to keep so,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A good resolution. Why did you not offer
me the Farm? I would have given you a better
price for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because, to tell you the truth, I was ashamed
to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You ought to have come to me, Warren,&quot;
said the Squire, kindly, as he placed one hand
on his shoulder. &quot;I gave you Irene, and you
ought to trust me. She was confided to my care
by my old friend, Carstone, and I do not want
to think I have made a mistake in placing her
happiness in your hands. You do not look easy
in your mind, or happy. If you are in any
difficulty tell me, and I will do all in my power
to help you for her sake and your own.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">These words struck the right chord in Warren
Courtly, but he had not the courage to confess
what he had done.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am upset over selling Holme Farm,&quot; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
replied, &quot;but there is nothing else, except the
barefaced audacity of such a man as Felix
Hoffman writing to Irene.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know the man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and I told her he was a scoundrel. He
shall feel my stick across his shoulders the next
time we meet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Better to have no scenes,&quot; said the Squire.
&quot;Avoid him in the future, but give him to
understand there must be no more letters written,
or he will be handed over to the police.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will probably be the best way. I met
him casually at Hurst Park, and he gave me
some very good information.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And on the strength of that,&quot; said the
Squire, &quot;I suppose he has stuck to you like a
leech. I know these men, they ought to be
ducked in a horsepond, they are pestilential
nuisances, but unfortunately there is no way of
killing them off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly rode home, where another
unpleasant surprise awaited him. Irene had
received a second letter from Felix Hoffman,
returning the five pounds and thanking her for
the loan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There,&quot; said Irene. &quot;I am right, and the
Squire is wrong. I felt sure from the tone of
his letter he would return the money, so he
cannot be quite so black as you painted him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>&quot;I am very much surprised, I assure you,&quot;
said Warren, &quot;but the return of the money
does not do away with the fact that it was a gross
piece of impertinence on his part to write to
you, and I shall call him to account for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This letter, returning the money, caused
Warren Courtly much uneasiness. He knew
it meant that Felix Hoffman was playing some
clever game, and that trouble was brewing at no
distant date. It was seldom Hoffman allowed
a five-pound note to leave his possession, no
matter how he obtained it. When he did so,
it was generally with the certainty of getting
many times its value in return.</p>

<h3>HOW ULICK BOUGHT THE SAINT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Ulick Maynard returned to London
after his brief visit to Eli Todd at Hazelwell, he
went to his rooms in West Kensington. Here
he had a comfortable flat, and lived as happily
as possible under the circumstances. He missed
his father's company; they were always together,
and there had never been angry words between
them until the night he left home. He sometimes
wondered had he done right to leave
Hazelwell in a sudden burst of anger, but he
could not have remained under such a cloud of
suspicion as his father enveloped him in.</p>

<p class="indent">If his father believed him guilty, what would
the neighbours think? They would naturally
one and all condemn him, so it was no doubt
for the best he had gone away for a time.</p>

<p class="indent">London is the safest place in the world for
a man to come to if he wishes to keep away
from his friends and relations. It is a difficult
matter to find anyone in the midst of the huge
whirl of traffic and millions of people constantly
pouring along its myriad thoroughfares.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick avoided no one, nor did he shun any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
places he wished to visit, lest he might be recognised.
He went about the same as any
casual visitor to the city, and although he had
been to London many times he had never become
so well acquainted with it before.</p>

<p class="indent">At first time hung heavily on his hands. He
missed all his country pursuits; the noise of the
city jarred upon him, and he longed for the
murmur of the stream, the sough of the wind
amongst the trees, the rustle of the grass, the
songs of birds, the lowing of cattle, the bleating
of sheep and lambs, and, more than all, the
merry neighing of the horses, and the joyous
bark of Bersak. He felt cramped, cooped up,
unable to breathe freely, and his whole being
revolted at the scenes around him. For hours
he roamed the vast city, watching the human
wrecks, the flotsam and jetsam of mankind,
being tossed about in the whirlpool of London
life, and wondered what became of them all,
where they housed at night, where they ended
their days, how they died, and if any living
soul mourned their departure.</p>

<p class="indent">Christmas came soon after his arrival in London.
It was the most dismal one he ever spent, and
he knew at Hazelwell there would be a corresponding
gloom. His heart was hardened against
his father then, and it was with some amount
of equanimity that he thought the Squire also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
suffered alone and in silence. Christmas Eve
he spent in the city, and watched the children
returning home ladened with toys and a variety
of parcels, their little arms clasped round their
treasures, holding them tight, fearful lest some
mishap should befall them. He saw the worn
faces of hard-working parents glowing with
pride and joy at the thought that out of their
toil they had been able to save something for their
little ones' pleasure. Late that night he saw
sights that made him shudder, and as he passed
woman after woman he was half afraid to look
at them, so utterly abandoned were their faces.</p>

<p class="indent">As he crossed Trafalgar Square he heard a
faint moan, and looking in the direction from
whence it came he saw a tiny boy and girl
huddled close together on a seat. It was a
bitterly cold night, and London was clothed in a
dirty, drizzling sleet. He crossed over to the
children, and the boy, pulling the girl closer to
him, looked at him with big, starving, staring
eyes. He questioned them and found they had
no home, no place wherein to lay their heads,
and they meant to remain there for the night,
unless the policeman moved them on, or took
them away. He asked if they could find lodgings
if he gave them the money, and the boy said he
could, but looked incredulous at the prospect
of such good fortune.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>Ulick gave him ten shillings in silver, and when
the lad saw it in his hand he cried for joy and
roused his sister to look at the harvest. She
inquired what the coins were, and he said
shillings, and that they would last them for many
days, until long after Christmas.</p>

<p class="indent">They showered thanks upon Ulick in their
childish way, and then trudged across the Square
with their arms round each other. They looked
back as they reached the Strand, and he waved
his hand to them. That night he slept badly,
he wondered why there was so much misery in
the world.</p>

<p class="indent">Time passed on, and early in the spring he
commenced to think a little racing would be a
pleasant recreation. He had no occasion to
hide from his fellows, for he had done no wrong,
and could hold his head high with the rest of
them.</p>

<p class="indent">He went to Epsom and saw the City and
Suburban, and while there he met his father's
old trainer, Fred May, who was delighted to
see him again. The Squire had not raced much
during the past few years, generally selling his
yearlings at Newmarket. Fred May had won
him many good races, and trained Honeysuckle
when she won her big event.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick did not tell the trainer that he had left
Hazelwell, he saw no necessity for it. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
chatted about old times, and May made many
inquiries about the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think he will ever race again?&quot;
asked May.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't fancy he will, but I shall, and I should
not mind speculating in something useful and
handing it over to your care,&quot; replied Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You really mean it?&quot; said Fred May.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I do,&quot; laughed Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I know where you can buy a youngster
that will come out at the top of the tree, and
if he is well-trained will make a grand three-year-old.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A two-year-old now?&quot; asked Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; he is by Father Confessor out of
Hilda, and is known as the Saint. He has not
run yet, but you can accept my word for it he
is a flyer. He's at Epsom, at Lowland Lodge,
and we can have a look at him after the races.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is the figure high? I do not wish to give
a big price, and I would have rather bought a
three or four-year-old,&quot; said Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Buy the Saint if you can, you will never
regret it,&quot; said the trainer.</p>

<p class="indent">After the races they walked down to Lowland
Lodge and inspected the Saint.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, he's a grey!&quot; exclaimed Ulick, in a
disappointed tone, as the door of the box was
opened.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>&quot;And there's been many a good grey racehorse,&quot;
replied Fred May. &quot;Never mind the
colour. Look him over, and fancy he is a bright
bay, or brown, or a chestnut, or anything you
like, only forget he's a grey, and then I'm sure
you will not find a fault in him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick was no mean judge of blood horses, and,
acting on the trainer's advice and ignoring the
colour, he looked the Saint carefully over. He
was rather anxious to find an excuse for declining
to buy him, but he failed; he was unable to
&quot;fault&quot; the colt in any way. He was well
shaped all over. His legs were sound and clean,
also his feet, well let down behind, tapering off
like a greyhound; he had also a strong back
and loins, and muscular thighs. There was
plenty of him in front of the saddle, and his
shoulders sloped well, his neck set on perfectly,
and his head denoted courage and endurance.
He seemed to be shaped for speed, and evidently
possessed staying powers. His colour was not
prepossessing, for he was not a good grey, and
this was the only fault Ulick could find with him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well!&quot; exclaimed the trainer, with a smile,
when he saw he had finished his inspection,
&quot;what do you think of him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is perfect in everything except his colour.
I must say he is about as bad a colour as a
racehorse well could be,&quot; replied Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>&quot;Granted that is so, his colour will not prevent
him winning. Do you recollect Buchanan winning
the Lincolnshire Handicap? No, of course not,
what am I thinking of? You were a little chap
then, I expect. Well, he was a funny looking
grey, something after the style of the Saint, but
he spread-eagled his field that day, and no
mistake. The race was run in a snowstorm,
and he faced it like a lion; it blew straight down
the course, and it was no light thing for a horse
to meet it in his teeth. He was a good grey,
and I have known others; it is all prejudice,
the colour is all right if the horse is good enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick hesitated. He felt tempted to buy,
for he knew Fred May's judgment was sound,
and that he seldom made mistakes. He had
not yet asked the price, perhaps it would be
prohibitory&mdash;he almost hoped so.</p>

<p class="indent">The owner of the Saint was anxious to sell him
for the same reason that Ulick hesitated about
buying; he did not like his colour. On this
account he asked a price that he thought would
tempt a wavering purchaser.</p>

<p class="indent">Two hundred guineas was the price placed
upon the Saint, and Ulick was forced to acknowledge
it was reasonable. He had seen yearlings
sold for five times the amount that had turned
out utter failures, and here was a two-year-old
that in all probability would make a clinker.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>Fred May made no remark when he heard the
price asked for the Saint, but he was determined
if Ulick did not buy him he would.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The figure is reasonable,&quot; said Ulick, &quot;but
I abominate the colour. That is the only reason
I do not feel inclined to buy him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you will not have him?&quot; asked the
owner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, thanks, and I am very much obliged to
you for showing him me and placing him on
offer,&quot; said Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">The owner laughed, and said, &quot;I am not
surprised; I want to sell him because he is such a
confoundedly bad colour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you quite made up your mind?&quot; asked
Fred May.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I'll take him at that figure,&quot; said Fred,
much to their surprise. &quot;I don't care twopence
about his colour, there's the make and shape
of a great horse there, and, grey or no grey, he'll
win races.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When will you take delivery?&quot; asked the
seller.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He can return home with the horses I have
at Epsom. They are at Tom Lucas's boxes.
I'll send a lad round for him this evening,&quot; said
May.</p>

<p class="indent">The bargain was completed; and Fred May
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
invited Ulick to accompany him to the house
where he was staying for the races.</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing more was said about the Saint until
after dinner, when Fred May remarked that they
might as well go and see if the ugly-coloured
customer looked any better in his new box.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid the change of boxes will not
improve him,&quot; said Ulick, &quot;but we can go and
see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Saint was quite at home in his quarters,
and the lad who brought him from Lowland
Lodge said he was as quiet as an old sheep.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is another point in his favour,&quot; said
May. &quot;There will be no trouble with the
starting machine in his case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick half wished he had bought him, more
especially as the trainer seemed so satisfied with
his bargain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you really think he will make a good
horse?&quot; asked Ulick, when they were in the
house again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am as certain of it as anyone can be over
such ticklish things as racehorses. I never saw
a much better shaped colt, and he's cheap enough
at the price.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I almost wish I had bought him,&quot; said Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can have him at the price I paid if you
wish,&quot; said May.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>&quot;That would hardly be fair to you,&quot; replied
Ulick. &quot;I must give you something for your
trouble. If you had not had the courage to
buy him, despite his colour, I should not have
the chance perhaps now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you really want him, pay me the two
hundred guineas for him, and let me train him,&quot;
said May.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That goes without saying,&quot; replied Ulick.
&quot;Of course, you will train him; I should not
think of sending horses elsewhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then let us conclude the bargain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well. I will give you the two hundred
guineas and leave him in your charge,&quot; replied
Ulick, and in this way he became the owner of
the Saint.</p>

<p class="indent">During the season the Saint fully endorsed
the good opinion formed of him by Fred May.
He won four races, in one of which he beat the
best of his year, much to the delight of Ulick
and the trainer.</p>

<p class="indent">The Saint went into winter quarters with an
unbeaten record, and racing men thought it a
pity he was not in any of the classical events,
but they were determined to keep an eye upon
him in handicaps.</p>

<p class="indent">Eli Todd was surprised when he learned that
Mr. Lanark, the owner of the Saint, was none
other than Ulick Maynard. The Squire would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
have been still more astounded had he been
enlightened upon the subject.</p>

<p class="indent">It was Ulick's firm determination to find
Janet Todd and induce her to return home. He
was thoroughly tired of being away from Hazelwell,
and he meant to force Janet, if necessary,
to tell her father the truth, and then Eli could
impart it to the Squire. He puzzled his brains
to think what Eli meant by saying it would
cause even more trouble than had already
occurred if what he partly suspected turned out
true.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick, however, did not believe that Eli
would withhold a confession from Janet from
his father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He wants more than mere suspicion to act
upon,&quot; said Ulick to himself, &quot;and he shall
have it if I can find Janet. I can deal with the
man who allowed the blame to fall upon me
when I discover his name, and I shall not
spare him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He often thought about Irene, and wondered
how she and Warren Courtly got on together.
He had never liked Warren, although he had
nothing against him, except his constant attentions
to Irene, and as a result his marriage with
her. This, however, he knew was partially his
own fault, although he doubted if he would ever
have succeeded in winning her. He left the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
course clear for Warren, and therefore rendered
it a comparatively easy task for him.</p>

<p class="indent">It never occurred to Ulick that Warren Courtly
had anything to do with the disappearance of
Janet Todd. Had it been suggested to him he
would have laughed at the idea as absurd.</p>

<h2><a name="CX" id="CX"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>&quot;THE CURIOSITY.&quot;</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Saint's first appearance as a three-year-old
was at Kempton Park in the Pastures Handicap,
a mile race on the Jubilee course. Having
wintered well, as the trainer anticipated, he
developed into a fine three-year-old, and in
the early spring had a real good trial with some
first-class handicap horses. Fred May was exceedingly
anxious to place the colt well, and
decided upon the Pastures Handicap because the
distance was suitable, and the class of horses he
was likely to meet in a five hundred pound race
would not trouble him much.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick agreed with him, and accordingly the
Saint was entered.</p>

<p class="indent">Contrary to their expectations, there were
some good horses in the race, including the
winner of the Lincolnshire Handicap, and a
four-year-old named Pinkerton, who had won
the Jubilee Stakes the year before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are in better company than I fancied we
should be,&quot; said Fred May, when he glanced
down the entries, &quot;and I expect we shall get a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
biggish weight. We can strike him out if he is
badly in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The handicap, however, proved to be a good
one, and although the Saint had eight stone,
a big weight early in the year for a three-year-old,
both Ulick and the trainer considered
he had a chance. Pinkerton had
eight stone twelve, and this horse they considered
the most dangerous. There are few
more enjoyable places than Kempton Park for
racing in the spring, or, in fact, at any time of
the year.</p>

<p class="indent">Although the Pastures Handicap was not the
principal race of the day, it attracted the most
attention, mainly on account of the Saint being
a runner. His two-year-old performances placed
him almost on a par with the Derby horses, and
the favourite for that race would have been
regarded as a certainty in the handicap with eight
stone. It was generally acknowledged by the
&quot;clever division&quot; that a four-year-old like
Pinkerton ought to be able to give the Saint
twelve pounds. Mulgar, Kit Cat, and Ringbell
were also fair performers, and Kit Cat had
been booked as a &quot;rod in pickle&quot; for some
time past. As she had only seven stone, it was
regarded as her &quot;day out&quot;&mdash;in other words,
that the weight was right and she was going for
the money.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>The ring was kept busy when betting was
opened on the Pastures Handicap. Four to one
bar one, was first shouted, Pinkerton being the
favourite, but these odds soon expanded until
it was four to one on the field.</p>

<p class="indent">In the paddock the Saint was the great attraction.
Everyone knew his two-year-old performances,
and his remarkable colour always
caused a mild sensation. He was &quot;washy&quot;
enough as a two-year-old, but this spring he was
almost white with a few &quot;flea-bitten&quot; spots on
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Looks as if he'd been powdered with black
pepper and salt,&quot; was one characteristic remark,
which certainly hit the mark.</p>

<p class="indent">Despite his colour, there was no mistaking the
quality and fitness of the horse. He had been
perfectly trained, hard and clean in his coat,
no dandified polish on it, but a real glow of
health.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He'd make the Derby horses go if they
ran against him now,&quot; said a well-known
pressman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are right, Harry. I fancy he'd start
pretty near favourite. I think I shall back
him,&quot; was the answer of a brother scribe.</p>

<p class="indent">The ladies crowded round &quot;the curiosity,&quot; as
the Saint was nicknamed, and a horse with a
nickname is as popular as a rosy-cheeked schoolboy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
dubbed &quot;apples.&quot; A nickname is a sure
sign of something out of the common in man,
boy, or horse.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The curiosity&quot; took the mobbing in good
part, it troubled him not at all, although he
condescendingly glanced round the ring from
time to time, and, as Fred May saddled him, made
playful snaps at his coat, and once succeeded in
securing his hat.</p>

<p class="indent">Ben Sprig was to ride the Saint; a good
jockey with a reputation for honesty. He was
a miniature man, about thirty-five, capable of
riding seven stone if necessary. His face was a
study. Ben Sprig seldom smiled outwardly; he
seemed to conceal all expressions of joy inside
his small frame, and the only signs of pleasure
experienced were sundry chuckles that sounded
like the cracking of nuts. He spoke jerkily,
shooting out his words like darts, and taking
time to consider between each one. His complexion
was bronze, and his eyes were small
and brown. He had beautifully-shaped small
hands and feet, of which he was very proud.
He was dapper in his dress, and always
clean and spruce. His humour was proverbial,
and as he always had a solemn countenance
it proved the more effective. A man
who laughs at his own jokes is like an advertiser
who stares at his own advertisements.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
There was none of the advertising agent about
Ben Sprig.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where's Ben?&quot; asked May, as the bell
rang.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll hunt him up,&quot; said Ulick, as he hurried
off towards the jockey's room.</p>

<p class="indent">Ben Sprig was a thorn in the side of all clerks
of the course. They invariably had to hurry
him up, and in nine cases out of ten he was always
the last to leave the paddock. He had a habit
of sneaking his mount up the course when the
majority of the spectators thought all the horses
were at the post.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come along, Ben,&quot; said Ulick. &quot;I never
saw such a fellow, you are always last.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Leaving the paddock,&quot; said Ben, solemnly.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick laughed as he replied, &quot;Not always in
that position at the finish, I grant you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ben was walking slowly along, the olive green
jacket adopted by Ulick being almost hidden
beneath a coat which came down to the heels of
his boots.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick was striding along in front; the clerk of
the course gesticulating furiously at Ben, who
took no notice whatever of him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hurry up,&quot; he said, as he rode up to the
jockey. &quot;You're always last, I wonder you
are not fined every time for being late at the
post.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>Ben pointed solemnly to the clock, and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are always behind time when you are
clerk of the course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ben was quickly in the saddle, and rode the
Saint quietly out on to the course, which was
cleared of the crowd. He sidled up to the rails,
and slipped along past the stands. He was
almost rounding the bend before the people
recognised the colours.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought the Saint had gone down long
ago?&quot; said one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's a trick of Ben Sprig's, he generally
goes up last,&quot; was the reply.</p>

<p class="indent">The noise at Tattersall's was deafening, and
although Pinkerton was a slight favourite, the
money had poured in for Kit Cat to such an
extent that she was about the worst runner in
many of the books.</p>

<p class="indent">The Saint stood at six to one, and Ulick had
succeeded in obtaining a point longer for his
money.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no delay at the post, Mr. Coventry
sending them off in his usual style.</p>

<p class="indent">Kit Cat was quickly on her legs, and came
along at a great pace, the golden stars on the
black jacket of her rider glittering in the sunlight.
Mulgar's white jacket also showed prominently,
and after a gap came Pinkerton, and the olive
green on the Saint.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>From the start the pace was fast, and Kit Cat
was making the most of her light weight. She
had an easy style of going, and looked strong
enough to carry a couple of stone more. Her
owner had not waited in vain to get in with
seven stone, and the money proved the mare
could go when required. He was regarded, not
without reason, as a very smart man. His
name, Conrad Rush, had often figured against
large winning accounts in Monday's settlement,
and the ring had a wholesale dread of him. He
never did anything underhand, but he possessed
an amount of patience that fairly wore the
handicappers out.</p>

<p class="indent">The golden stars leading in a mile race meant
mischief, and already backers of Kit Cat were
on good terms with themselves. The mare
rounded the bend going in grand style, revelling
in her light weight, and pulling hard. So far, it
was a one-horse race, but creeping up on the
rails not far behind were Pinkerton's blue jacket,
the Saint, and Mulgar. To these four horses it
soon became evident the race belonged; which
would win?</p>

<p class="indent">Already the murmur of many voices could be
heard in the rings. The sound gradually increased
until it swelled into a roar, and louder and louder
it became as the horses drew nearer.</p>

<p class="indent">Kit Cat still held a commanding lead, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
it seemed almost impossible she could be
caught.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They don't win there,&quot; said Fred May to
Ulick, &quot;and the Saint has a rare turn of speed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's a lot of ground to make up,&quot; he replied,
&quot;but I hope he'll do it. Pinkerton is running
well, but Kit Cat has such a light weight she
ought to last it out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I fancy Conrad Rush has overshot his mark
this time. I have never seen the mare cover a
mile. She may do it, but I doubt it. Look at her
now&mdash;by Jove, she's done, I felt pretty sure of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick saw the rider on Kit Cat &quot;niggling&quot; at
her, and a second or two later he raised his whip
as he heard the horses behind drawing nearer.</p>

<p class="indent">The bookmakers were jubilant and howled
with delight.</p>

<p class="indent">Kit Cat responded to the call, but it was a
mere flash in the pan.</p>

<p class="indent">Pinkerton was the first to tackle her on the
outside, and as he drew level she swerved towards
him and bored him out. This left an opening on
the rails, which looked dangerous to squeeze
through. Ben Sprig never flinched when he
got a chance, however small he took it. He did
so on this occasion. He was watching the two
horses in front of him with keen eyes, and no
sooner did Kit Cat swerve than he slid the Saint
forward with one great effort and secured the lead.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>It was a clever bit of jockeyship on the part
of the rider, a marvellous run on the part of
the horse, and the combined effort drew forth a
hearty cheer.</p>

<p class="indent">The rider of Pinkerton had not expected this;
he fancied the Saint was shut in on the rails,
and would have to go round him on the outside.
When he saw the olive green jacket on the other
side of Kit Cat, it is needless to say he was
surprised.</p>

<p class="indent">Pinkerton was not beaten, and as the pair
cleared Kit Cat a tremendous race home ensued.
It was a thrilling moment. Pinkerton had won
over this course, and that was in his favour.
The Saint had not run on it before. The four-year-old
and the three-year-old struggled gamely
on, with a difference of twelve pounds between
them.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick was excited; he had not seen the Saint
in such a tight place before, and he hoped he
would get out of it.</p>

<p class="indent">The horses were close to the winning post, a
few more strides would decide it. They fought
out every yard of the ground. Ben Sprig was a
great finisher. He graduated in a good school,
and he clung to the old tradition that a bit left
for a finish is worth a hundred yards at any other
part of the race.</p>

<p class="indent">His face was set, and his little eyes gleamed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
His small hands gripped the reins firmly, his
knees pressed the Saint's sides, and he helped
the horse all he knew how. The olive jacket and
the blue were level, the next few strides would
do it; which would win?</p>

<p class="indent">A moment of suspense, a second or two of
breathless silence, then a mighty shout.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Saint! The Saint!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick echoed the cry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Saint wins!&quot; he shouted.</p>

<p class="indent">Ben Sprig's immovable face showed no signs
of the triumph within. He knew he had ridden
one of his best races, he felt much of the success
was due to his horsemanship, and he was pleased
with himself. He slid past the judge's box about
three parts of a length in front of Pinkerton, with
Kit Cat a bad third.</p>

<p class="indent">The Saint's performance was acknowledged
on all sides to be a great one, and &quot;the curiosity&quot;
was mobbed as Ben rode him in amidst cheers.
Mr. Lanark was not well known, but the Saint
had made the olive green jacket popular.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You rode a splendid race, Ben,&quot; said
Ulick. &quot;I think the best you ever rode on
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ben Sprig had ridden the Saint throughout
his two-year-old career.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I agree with you,&quot; jerked Ben. &quot;I did ride
a good race, the saints be praised.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>&quot;I expect you felt a bit uneasy when you
squeezed through on the rails?&quot; laughed
Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at all; I'm used to squeezing. I've been
squeezing all my life to make both ends meet,&quot;
said Ben.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then from all accounts you have squeezed
to some purpose,&quot; said Ulick, for Ben Sprig was
reported to be rich.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could lend some of 'em a trifle, I have no
doubt,&quot; he replied, &quot;but look at the time I have
been at it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They joined Fred May in the paddock, and
looked at the Saint walking round.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's the rummiest coloured beggar I ever
rode or saw,&quot; said Ben.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bar his colour, what do you think of him?&quot;
asked May.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's an out-and-out good one, and as game
as they make 'em. If it came to a match between
him and the Derby winner I would back him,
provided I rode him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's a pretty tall order,&quot; said Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would come off, you can take my word
for it,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p class="indent">A friend came up to Ulick, and they
walked away together. After some conversation
as to the merits of the Saint's victory,
he said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>&quot;How are you going back to town&mdash;by
train?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have to go on to Windsor. Drive with me
to Feltham and go to Waterloo from there, unless
you will come with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick thanked him, said he would drive to
Feltham, but declined to go to Windsor.</p>

<p class="indent">After the races they took a carriage to Feltham,
driving through Hanworth Park, and down the
High Street.</p>

<p class="indent">They were chatting over racing matters, when
his friend exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By Jove! there's a pretty girl&mdash;well dressed,
too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick looked up and gave a start of
surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">It was Janet Todd. She had not seen him,
of that he felt sure. She was going down the
street, and he resolved to leave his friend at the
station, walk back, and meet her. It was a lucky
chance that caused him to come this way back
from the races.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know her?&quot; asked his friend, smiling,
as he saw him start.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I fancy I do; I am almost sure of it. I
think I'll walk back and meet her after I leave
you,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't blame you, my friend,&quot; he said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
laughing. &quot;Does she come from your part of
the world?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am almost sure of it,&quot; replied Ulick; &quot;at
any rate, I mean to find out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good luck to you,&quot; laughed his friend, as he
shook hands and went into the station.</p>

<h2><a name="CXI" id="CXI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>FOR A WOMAN'S SAKE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ulick</span> walked out of the station yard and along
the High Street. He saw Janet coming down on
the opposite side of the road, and wondered
whether it would be best to stop her or to watch
where she went. He would, no doubt, surprise
her if he spoke to her in the street, and perhaps
the suddenness of his appearance might cause a
scene. He decided it would be the better plan
to allow her to pass, and then follow her. He
went into a shop, made a trifling purchase, and
saw her pass by.</p>

<p class="indent">When he went out she was turning round by
the church, and he followed some distance away.
He saw her enter a house, where she probably
lived, but he waited some time in case she came
out again. When she did not he went up to the
door and rang the bell.</p>

<p class="indent">As he heard it ring he wondered who to ask
for. She would not be living there under her
own name, at all events it was unlikely.</p>

<p class="indent">Fortune favoured him, for Mrs. Hoffman was
out and Janet was alone in the house.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>She opened the door and stood face to face
with Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">The shock was great; she felt faint and giddy,
and caught hold of the door, but, recovering
herself, gasped out&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Maynard, what are you doing here?
How did you find me out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I saw you as I drove from Kempton Park
to Feltham, and came back from the station to
meet you. I thought, however, it would be
better to see you in your house, as I might have
startled you in the street.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am very glad you did,&quot; she replied. &quot;Will
you come in?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, I should like to have a little
conversation with you,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder if he knows?&quot; thought Janet,
and quickly decided he could hardly do so. Then
arose the question should she tell him? No,
it would be better to keep her secret for the
present.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will not be offended if I put some plain
questions to you, I hope,&quot; said Ulick. &quot;I have
suffered a good deal on your account; that
must be my excuse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ask me anything you like, and I will try
and answer it,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you living alone here?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Janet. &quot;Mrs. Hoffman and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
her son are the only other occupants of the
house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad of it,&quot; he replied; &quot;it will make
my task less difficult.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you wish to do?&quot; she asked,
timidly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I saw your father early in the New Year, on
New Year's Day, and I promised him I would
find you, and persuade you to return home,&quot; he
replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot do that,&quot; said Janet, firmly. &quot;It
is impossible. You would be the first to say so,
if you knew all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me all, and let me judge what is best
to be done,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That, also, is impossible, I know you mean
well, and I thank you for your kindness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your father will be very glad to have you
back; he will forget the past; he has long since
forgiven you, but not the man who tempted
you to leave home. I wish I had known what
you were about to do the night I left home.
I would have stopped you and saved you at any
cost.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Janet Todd shuddered. She was glad he had
not met her and Warren Courtly, or there was no
telling what might have happened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot undo all I have done,&quot; she said.
&quot;Some day it may be possible for me to go back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
to my father without any danger or trouble to
others, but at present I cannot. Believe me, I
would do so if it were possible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Consider well what you are saying,&quot; he said.
&quot;If I give your father your address he will come
and take you away, you cannot refuse to go with
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must not do it&mdash;indeed you must not,&quot;
pleaded Janet, earnestly. &quot;Oh, if you only
knew, you would leave the house at once. It is
better for you to go and forget you have seen
me.&quot; He was surprised at her agitation, which
he saw was genuine. There was something in the
background he could not understand, and her
father had thrown out hints in the same way.
What was the mystery, and why was it necessary
to keep him in the dark?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Janet, will you tell me who the man is
you ran away with? I will not mention it
to anyone if you desire me not to do so. If
I know, I may be better able to help you,&quot;
said Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot tell you; it is impossible,&quot; she
replied. &quot;Please do not ask me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It must have been someone in the neighbourhood,
but I cannot think who would do such a
cowardly action,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">This was dangerous ground, and Janet said
quickly&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>&quot;You can tell my father you have seen me,
that I am well, and will come to him as soon as
I possibly can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is not sufficient. It is my duty to let
him know where you are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you do I must leave here, and I am very
comfortable. Mrs. Hoffman is kind to me, and
has always been so. Please allow matters to
remain as they are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick looked at her, and thought his friend
was right in describing Janet as a pretty woman.
She evidently lived a regular life, and he was
glad to see a healthy glow on her cheeks. Whatever
her faults in the past, she was living a
decent, quiet life now, of that he felt certain.
It would be a great consolation to Eli to know
this.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you feel compelled to remain hidden here
for a time,&quot; he said at last, &quot;I will keep your
secret, but you must allow me to write to your
father and tell him you are well and living a
respectable life. That will ease his mind, and
he will wait for your return more patiently. It
is right he should know, for he has suffered
much on your account.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She thanked him, and gave the permission he
required, again entreating him not to mention
her address.</p>

<p class="indent">The gate opened, and Mrs. Hoffman came into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
the house. She was surprised to see Ulick, and
looked at him sharply, thinking to herself, &quot;I
wonder what he is doing here? Perhaps he is a
friend of Mr. Warren's?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Hoffman always addressed Janet as Mrs.
Warren; it sounded more respectable.</p>

<p class="indent">Janet was at a loss what to say; she did not
wish to give Ulick's name, in case Warren
Courtly might hear he had called.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A friend of yours, Mrs. Warren?&quot; said Mrs.
Hoffman, with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Janet, &quot;a very old friend. I
knew him when I was a little girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Warren,&quot; thought Ulick, thinking the
name sounded familiar, but never dreaming of
connecting it with Warren Courtly.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Hoffman was fond of hearing herself talk,
and launched out upon a variety of topics until
Ulick wished her anywhere but in his presence.
He thought, however, it was diplomatic, for
Janet's sake, to be polite, and Mrs. Hoffman
was delighted to find such an attentive listener.
As a rule, her tirades were cut short with scant
ceremony.</p>

<p class="indent">She pressed him to have a cup of tea, and,
thinking this was the only way to get rid of her
for a time he consented.</p>

<p class="indent">He went to the window and looked out into the
street and saw someone walking down. He could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
hardly believe his eyes when he recognised
Warren Courtly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What on earth is he doing here?&quot; he
thought.</p>

<p class="indent">Janet followed him, and when she saw Warren
she turned as pale as death, standing almost
rigid, unable to move.</p>

<p class="indent">They must not meet. Whatever happened they
must not meet. That was her one thought, her
sole desire.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick's eyes were fixed upon Warren. She
pulled his sleeve. When he turned round and saw
her face it told him all.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good God,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Irene, what
about Irene?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He seized Janet's wrist, and pressed it so tightly
that she almost screamed out with pain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Irene, his wife; good heavens, his wife, she
must never know! Do you hear, she must
never know; it would kill her. Do you hear
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Janet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Promise you will never breathe a word to
her of this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I promise. You will help me if I require
help?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will, Janet. He must not see me,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Janet pulled him towards the door and led
him into the kitchen.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>&quot;Well, I never!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Hoffman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no time for any explanation,&quot; said
Ulick. &quot;Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Warren is coming,&quot; put in Janet, &quot;and
Mr. Hazelwell&quot;&mdash;it was the name that came first
to her mind&mdash;&quot;does not wish to meet him;
they are not friends.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The door bell rang.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep him here until Mr. Warren is gone,&quot;
said Janet. &quot;I will attend to the door.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Hoffman was shocked. Why was it necessary
for Mr. Hazelwell's visit to be concealed
from Mr. Warren? She would not allow these
goings on in her house. One thing, however,
there was no getting over, and that was there
was a gentleman in her kitchen, and she
had asked him to have some tea. He was
a good-looking gentleman into the bargain,
and Mrs. Hoffman flattered herself there
were considerable remains of her early beauty
left.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry this has occurred,&quot; said Ulick;
&quot;but I really do not wish to meet Mr.
Warren.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Didn't you know it was Mrs. Warren who
lived here?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I saw her in Feltham. She was a playmate
of mine years ago. I had no idea she was
married.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>&quot;It is strange you should know Mr. Warren,
too,&quot; said Mrs. Hoffman, curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Remarkable, I call it,&quot; he replied, as he
accepted the cup of tea handed him.</p>

<p class="indent">He heard voices in the next room and the
tones were angry.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick was dumbfounded at the discovery he
had made. He saw now, and understood Janet's
reason for not wishing to return home, and he
appreciated her delicacy. It was some consolation
to think Warren Courtly got into this mess
before he married Irene, not after; and yet,
judging from his presence here, he was keeping
up the connection. His feelings can be better
imagined than described. He loved Irene, he
had found out the truth ever since he lost her.
She must never know it was Warren Courtly
who tempted Janet away from her home and
allowed all the suspicion to fall upon himself.
At the thought of Warren's perfidy, his blood
boiled, and he would have gone into the next
room with pleasure and called him to account,
There was no reason why he should not do so.
No reason? Only one, and that everything to
him. He could bear the blame cast unjustly
upon himself, the separation from his father, the
loss of all the pursuits he loved, and a hundred
times more, for Irene's sake. Irene was the one
reason why he would not call Warren Courtly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
to account. He knew her nature, and how she
would suffer if the truth reached her ears. She
was not likely to hear it from anyone except
himself or Janet, and she had promised not to
tell. Did Eli suspect Warren Courtly? He
thought of his words, and felt he meant that if
what he suspected turned out true, it would
cause great trouble at Anselm Manor. Eli would
not be the man to cause that trouble.</p>

<p class="indent">The voices in the next room grew louder, and
Mrs. Hoffman said, &quot;I am afraid they are quarrelling.
Mr. Warren is a very irritable man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does he come here often?&quot; asked Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, he leaves her too much alone. He ought
to be thankful he has me to look after her. Mrs.
Warren is young, pretty, and inexperienced; he
has no business to neglect her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick was glad to hear he neglected her;
it was a sign he wished to spare Irene's
feelings.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren remained about half an hour, and then
left. He would have been very uneasy had he
known Ulick Maynard was on the premises, and
still more that he knew all about his connection
with Janet. He had, as usual, quarrelled with
her over money matters, but she had won in the
end, as she was bound to do, considering the
hold she had over him. She did not mean to let
him shirk his responsibilities and he had no idea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
she would not have betrayed him to Irene under
any circumstances.</p>

<p class="indent">She came into the kitchen and said, &quot;You
may come in now, Mr. Hazelwell&mdash;the coast is
clear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick was glad to escape from Mrs. Hoffman,
and when she was left alone that good lady
commenced to sum up the situation to her own
satisfaction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are rivals, that's what it is,&quot; she said;
&quot;and this one is worth half-a-dozen Mr. Warrens.
There's no telling what men will do where a
pretty face is concerned. I know what it is
myself, and to think I should have thrown myself
away on such a fellow as Hoffman when I
might have had anybody in those days. Mrs.
Warren's in my charge, and she must be careful;
but I like a little bit of romancing, and it strikes
me I'm likely to get it in this situation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick had a serious talk with Janet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it because Warren Courtly is the man
who took you away from home that you
decline to return to your father's house?&quot; he
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think you are right, now I know the facts.
It will be better for me not to mention having seen
you; it will only make Eli uneasy and anxious
to know more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>She agreed with him, and promised to write
to him if necessary.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Were you quarrelling?&quot; he added.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We had some words, as usual, about money
matters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He makes you an allowance still?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I could not live here without, and he
has a right to do it,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Hoffman says he seldom comes here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is true.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad,&quot; said Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So am I. When he married Miss Carstone
I made up my mind to see as little of him as
possible. He promised to marry me when I ran
off with him,&quot; said Janet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He deceived you, and deserves to suffer for
it, but his wife must not be dragged into it,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She will never learn anything from me,&quot;
Janet answered, earnestly.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick went back to London thinking over the
varied chances of the day, and wondering at the
strange discovery he had made.</p>

<p class="indent">So it was Warren Courtly who had robbed Eli
of his daughter, and allowed the blame to rest
on him. He would let Warren see that he knew
the truth, that much satisfaction he meant having,
but Irene must be shielded no matter what
happened. How different events might have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
turned out had he stuck to his guns and won
Irene, in spite of Warren Courtly, and the suspicions
surrounding himself. Had he done so, no
doubt the truth would have come to light in a
very short time; as it was, he must trust to his
luck to clear the way for him.</p>

<h2><a name="CXII" id="CXII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>TWO SCHEMERS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Squire noticed an estrangement had taken
place between Irene and her husband. She was
too proud to allow her real feelings to appear on
the surface, but he saw below it and knew there
was discord somewhere.</p>

<p class="indent">Redmond Maynard, since his son's departure,
had led a lonely life. Everyone in the county
sympathised deeply with him, but he was not a
man to be soothed with kindly words; on the
contrary, they irritated him. He went about his
daily avocations as usual, but it was evident he
had lost much of the interest in his surroundings.
Dr. Harding ordered a change, but the Squire
protested he was in a perfect state of health, and
that there was no occasion for him to leave
Hazelwell. The doctor was an old and valued
friend, in addition to being his medical attendant.
He practised in various parts of the county, his
connection being select and extensive. Dr.
Harding's was a familiar figure in the hunting
field, and when he could spare the time he was
nothing loth to attend a race meeting. He was
an excellent shot, and always had a standing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
invitation to join the parties at Hazelwell. Of
late, however, visitors there had been few and
far between, and Dr. Harding saw the Squire
was gradually falling into a fit of despondency
which boded ill for his health. He spoke to Irene
about it, knowing the influence she had over him,
and requested her to persuade him to go south
for a time. This she did in her own winning way,
promising Warren and herself would accompany
him if he thought well.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is an inducement certainly, to have
your company,&quot; he said. &quot;I will think it over.
I expect Harding has been putting you up to
this,&quot; he added, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dr. Harding is only anxious about your
health, and I am sure he advises you for the
best,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am aware of that,&quot; replied the Squire;
&quot;but we do not always follow the advice we ask.
It is foolish, of course, and we ought to obey
the doctor when we call him in. I rather fancy
a change would do you good, Irene, you are not
happy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked troubled and said quickly&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are mistaken, I am perfectly happy;
I have everything to make me contented.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has Warren been behaving himself lately?&quot;
he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He always behaves himself,&quot; was her answer.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>&quot;I am glad you think so; I do not,&quot; he said
gruffly. &quot;Warren is going the pace, and you
know it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His anxiety about Irene caused him for a time
to forget his own troubles.</p>

<p class="indent">Eli Todd watched the Squire, and noted how
worn and aged he was growing. This caused him
many qualms of conscience; he knew the cause,
and would have liked to remove it. He wrote a
long letter to Ulick, telling him how his father's
health suffered, and begging him to return.
This caused him to wonder if he was doing right
in remaining away. Now that he knew everything
connected with Janet's disappearance from
home, he felt it was impossible for him to go to
Hazelwell and meet Irene, as he was sure to do.
He wrote to Eli, explaining as well as he could
that it was impossible for him to return at
present, but circumstances might arise which
would enable him to do so at no distant date.
With this Eli had to rest contented, but he would
have preferred something more definite.</p>

<p class="indent">It was shortly after the Saint's great race with
Pinkerton at Kempton that the Squire came
into Eli's cottage and sat down for a chat. Eli
gave him full particulars of all the mares and
youngsters in the stud, and said there would
be some good prices realised at Doncaster in
September.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>&quot;Honeysuckle's foal will be a tip-topper,&quot; said
Eli. &quot;He'll run well into four figures.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall not sell him,&quot; replied the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">Eli was glad to hear this; it meant the Squire
thought of racing again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall you have him trained?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, it is some time since I gave Fred May
a turn. By the way, he has got hold of a champion
in the Saint. That must have been a splendid
race at Kempton. I wonder who Mr. Lanark is?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A new recruit to the turf,&quot; said Eli, smiling,
&quot;and he has made a rare good start.&quot; &quot;He
little thinks his son owns the Saint,&quot; thought
Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has got into the right hands. Fred May
is thoroughly honest. Mr. Lanark, whoever he
is, may congratulate himself. I wonder if he
would sell the Saint?&quot; said the Squire, half to
himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Eli smiled; he thought it would be a curious
thing if the Squire bought his son's horse. It
occurred to him this might be the means of
bringing them together.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should think it would be a difficult matter
to induce him to part with him,&quot; said Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There can be no harm in trying,&quot; said the
Squire. &quot;I like the Saint's breeding; he would
do well for the stud.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not run down to Fred May's and see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
what can be done?&quot; said Eli. &quot;It will be a
change for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it will, and you had better come with
me. I ought to write and let him know we are
coming.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will do it to save you the trouble,&quot; said
Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, fix it for next Thursday, if that
will suit Mr. Lanark, providing he is willing to
sell,&quot; replied the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">Eli cudgelled his brains how to bring about the
meeting he desired. If Ulick knew his father
was coming to Newmarket to see the Saint he
would not be present, of that Eli felt certain.
The only plan that suggested itself to him was
to take Fred May into his confidence, for it
was evident to Eli the trainer knew nothing of
the misunderstanding between father and son. He
wrote his letter after much deliberation, and
anxiously awaited the reply. It came by return
of post, and in it the trainer plainly showed how
astonished he was at the breach between them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will do all in my power to help you to heal
it,&quot; he wrote, &quot;but I am afraid we shall get into
trouble. Neither the Squire nor his son like being
dictated to, and they will probably think we
have taken a liberty. However, we will risk it.
Bring him on Thursday, and I'll see that his son
is here, you can leave that to me. If we can effect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
a reconciliation we shall have done much good.
The Saint is an extraordinarily good colt, equal
to the best Derby form, and I am very glad I
advised Mr. Maynard to buy him. Tell the
Squire there is no price upon him, but that Mr.
Lanark will be delighted to see him and show
him his champion, and one or two more he has in
my stable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Eli sent a note up to the Squire stating the
matter was arranged, and they had better go
to London on the Wednesday, and on to Newmarket
next day.</p>

<p class="indent">To this arrangement he agreed, and sent Bob
Heather with a letter to tell Irene of his intention.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you and Warren come to town I will meet
you at the Walton Hotel on Friday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene sent back a reply to the effect that they
would be there, as Warren had to go up to town
again at the end of the week.</p>

<p class="indent">When Ulick received a letter from his trainer
requesting him to go to Newmarket on Wednesday,
he hastened down at once, fearing something
might have gone wrong with the Saint.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's all right,&quot; said Fred May, in reply to
Ulick's anxious inquiries, &quot;but I have some
rather startling news for you. A gentleman is
coming to see him to-morrow; he wishes to buy
him. I thought you would have no objection
to showing him the Saint yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>Ulick laughed as he replied, &quot;He is coming
on a useless errand; I would not sell him at any
price.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never refuse a good offer,&quot; said Fred May.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Surely you would not like to lose him?&quot;
he replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly not, but I should advise you all
the same to take a stiff price.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't you think he will stand training?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a shadow of doubt about that,&quot; was the
trainer's reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I shall not part with him. Who is the
gentleman?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not quite sure, but I fancy he is rather
an exalted person,&quot; said Fred, mysteriously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have brought me down on a wild-goose
chase,&quot; laughed Ulick. &quot;You don't even know
the name of the intending purchaser. I am
surprised at you, Fred; however, I forgive
you. I am always glad of an excuse to run
down to Newmarket and have a gallop on the
Heath.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire and Eli came by an early train,
and arrived at Stanton House, the trainer's
residence, unseen by Ulick, who happened to
be reading the paper in Fred May's room.</p>

<p class="indent">After a few words of welcome with his old
patron, the trainer said he would tell Mr. Lanark
they were here, and left the room. Eli felt very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
uncomfortable; he wondered if there would be
an explosion. He had agreed with Fred May that
it would be better to leave them alone together.</p>

<p class="indent">The door opened, and the trainer said, &quot;This
is Mr. Lanark, I think you know him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Father and son were face to face, and, taking
advantage of their astonishment and consternation,
the trainer and Eli beat a retreat, wondering
how their plot would succeed.</p>

<p class="indent">For a few moments neither of them spoke.
Both knew they had been brought together by
Eli and the trainer. At last a smile came over
the Squire's face, and he said, as he held out his
hand, &quot;We have been caught cleverly, Ulick,
and I trust it is all for the best; it is a long time
since we met, my boy.&quot; His voice shook at the
finish, and this touched Ulick; he noticed how
his father had changed, he seemed much older,
and his face more worn. He clasped his hand
and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have both suffered; it was all a mistake.&quot;
He seemed at a loss for words. Had his father
decided to do him justice, or did he still suspect
him? It would be impossible for him to return
to Hazelwell at present, and be constantly meeting
Warren and his wife; that was more than he
could endure, and yet he was unable to explain
the reason to his father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you are Mr. Lanark,&quot; said the Squire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
laughing more heartily than he had done for
many a day.</p>

<p class="indent">Eli and the trainer, listening like two guilty
schoolboys in the hall, heard him, and the former
said, joyfully&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's all right, Fred, that's the Squire's laugh,
and right glad I am to hear it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's splendid,&quot; said Fred, as he rubbed his
hands in high glee; &quot;we must crack a bottle
over this, Eli, come along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am Mr. Lanark,&quot; said Ulick, &quot;and I own the
Saint, but he is not for sale,&quot; he added, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind the horse at present; tell me
what you have been doing,&quot; said the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Living quietly in a flat in West Kensington,
and doing a little racing,&quot; replied Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not quite so pleasant as Hazelwell?&quot; inquired
his father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no place quite like Hazelwell to my
mind,&quot; said his son. &quot;I was fearfully dull and
miserable at first, but I have become fairly used
to it now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will come back to our home?&quot; was the
next question.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick looked troubled; what could he say,
how make an excuse?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no occasion to hesitate,&quot; said the
Squire. &quot;Return with me to-day; the flat can
look after itself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>The temptation was great. He thought of
Hazelwell and all it meant to him; then he
thought of Irene. If he was constantly in
Warren's company he felt he must betray
himself. Better to stay away, far better for all
of them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot return to-day, father,&quot; he said,
quietly. &quot;I have very good reasons for not
doing so. Trust me, believe in me; I am acting
for the best, as one day you will discover.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire's face clouded. &quot;He dare not face
us all after what he has done,&quot; was his thought.
He sighed heavily, and his son knew what it
meant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You still believe me guilty,&quot; he said. &quot;You
are wrong, quite wrong. I can prove my innocence,
but you ought not to require that of me.
Cannot you trust me, father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The appealing tone in his voice was unmistakable,
there was a ring of sincerity in it, and the
Squire wavered. Ulick had not been accustomed
to deceiving him. If he could only bring himself
to believe in his innocence; but the evidence
was damning, and now his refusal to return to
Hazelwell confirmed it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know who took Janet Todd away
from home?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Ulick, in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; exclaimed the Squire, in a tone of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
satisfaction. &quot;Then why have you not given
me his name long ago?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I only discovered it the other day,
and that quite by accident.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is the scoundrel?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must,&quot; thundered the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick remained silent, nothing his father
might say would make him break his resolve.
It was hard, very hard, and at that moment he
hated Warren Courtly heartily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, my boy,&quot; said his father, in a milder
tone, &quot;let there be no more differences between
us. Are you satisfied if I say I am convinced of
your innocence, and ask you to forgive me for
my unjust suspicions? I regret the hasty, angry
words I said that night. Come back home with
me, and let bygones be bygones.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick was moved, for he knew what it cost
his father to speak such words, and acknowledge
himself in the wrong. It was an appeal that cut
him to the heart to refuse.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you knew all, father, you would say I was
acting right not to return home at present. To
hear you say you are convinced of my innocence
has lifted a heavy load from me, and I thank you
for those words with all my heart. How I long
to return to Hazelwell, you must know, and therefore
will understand the weighty reasons I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
for not doing so. Trust me, father, believe in
me, and I shall be the happiest man alive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire did not hesitate. He spoke steadily
as he said, &quot;I will trust you, my son. We have
been separated too long. If you cannot return
with me, I know there must be grave cause of
which I know nothing. What it is I cannot
imagine, but you will tell me some day, and I
hope and pray that it will not be long. If you
will not return with me to Hazelwell, you must
come to the Walton with me and spend a few
days.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Willingly,&quot; said Ulick. &quot;It will be like the
good old times for us to be together again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I feel a new man,&quot; said the Squire, heartily,
as he rose to his feet. &quot;We will go and find
those two schemers, Eli and Fred, and then have
a look at the Saint.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CXIII" id="CXIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>THE SQUIRE AND THE SAINT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Redmond Maynard</span> opened the door, and,
followed by his son, went in search of the culprits.
He knew his way about Stanton House, having
often stayed there when Fred May trained his
horses.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know where we shall find them,&quot; he said,
&quot;in May's room.&quot; They entered without ceremony
and surprised the worthy pair enjoying a
glass of champagne. They looked ludicrously
guilty, and the Squire burst out laughing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You think you are very clever, no doubt,&quot; he
said. &quot;As it happens, everything has turned out
for the best, but you might have got into trouble
had it been otherwise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We had not much doubt about succeeding, or
we should not have risked it,&quot; said Eli. &quot;I am
sure you are not sorry we did so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, we are perfectly satisfied,&quot; replied the
Squire, &quot;and you both deserve credit for all you
have done.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The trainer sent for another bottle of
champagne, and the Squire and Ulick joined
them.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>&quot;There is no chance of buying the Saint, Mr.
Lanark says,&quot; remarked the Squire, smiling; &quot;but
as the horse is in the family I do not see that it
matters much. One thing you must promise me,
when he has finished racing you will send him to
the Hazelwell stud.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With pleasure,&quot; replied his son. &quot;But he
will stand a lot of training.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall be surprised if he is not running as
an aged horse,&quot; said the trainer, &quot;for I never saw
one with better legs or a sounder constitution;
he is built for work, and cannot have too much of
it. I only wish he was in the Derby, he is the
very horse for that race.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us go and see him,&quot; said the Squire.
And they went towards the stables.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder what my father will think of his
colour?&quot; said Ulick to the trainer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will surprise him, and he will be disappointed
as you were, until he looks him over,&quot;
was the reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Eli, I shall not forget what you have done for
us,&quot; said the Squire, as they walked across the
yard. &quot;I know it was your plan that brought us
together. What made you think of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I saw you were feeling the separation more
every week, and I determined to put a stop to it
if I could, so I took Fred May into my confidence,
and he eagerly agreed to my scheme.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>&quot;I wonder why Ulick will not return to Hazelwell
with me?&quot; mused the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is he not going home with you?&quot; asked Eli,
surprised.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, he says he has good reasons for not doing
so. He knows who ran away with Janet, but he
cannot tell me. Do you know?&quot; asked the Squire,
quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; stammered Eli, thinking to himself
perhaps Ulick's suspicions rested upon the same
man as his own.</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire looked at him keenly, and said,
&quot;I believe you do. Confound it, I cannot make
it out at all; why am I kept in the dark?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Eli was glad when the trainer called out,
&quot;You are going too far; this is the Saint's box.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire's mind was diverted, and he turned
sharply round and walked back.</p>

<p class="indent">The trainer threw open the door of the
box, and the Saint was stripped for their
inspection.</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire looked at him in astonishment, and
said, &quot;Is this a joke, that cannot be the Saint?
What a horrible colour! I never saw such a
dirty grey before.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They laughed, and Eli was as much taken aback
as his master.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is the Saint,&quot; said Ulick, &quot;and I am not
surprised you do not like his colour. I thought as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
you think when I first looked at him, and so
did his owner, who parted with him solely
because of his colour, and has regretted it ever
since. I refused to purchase him for no other
reason.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then who bought him?&quot; asked the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fred May, and resold him to me at the price
he gave for him. If it had not been for him I
should not have had the colt at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Upon my word I cannot help being disappointed,&quot;
said the Squire. &quot;He is not fit to
look at.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The trainer laughed heartily, as he replied,
&quot;Come, Mr. Maynard, that is too bad, after all
he has done. He has never been beaten yet, and
do not forget he 'downed' the present Derby
favourite as a two-year-old. Forget his colour,
and examine him for his good qualities. I do
not think you will find a fault with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire went up to the Saint and carefully
handled him. He was a considerable time making
his inspection, and said at the conclusion&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are right; I cannot find fault with him,
he is perfect, except for his colour. What a pity
it is; it will never do to breed from him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should chance it,&quot; said Ulick. &quot;He may
get them a much better colour than himself,
and as far as make and shape and performances
are concerned, he cannot very well be beaten.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>&quot;When does he run again?&quot; asked the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the Coronation Cup in Derby week. It
is run over the Derby course, and we want to
show them what he can do. He'll meet last year's
Derby winner, the Cesarewitch winner, and the
Gold Cup winner of last season; if that is not
a test of his quality, I do not know where it is
to be found,&quot; said May.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will be a race,&quot; replied the Squire, &quot;and
I must be there to see it. I have a very good
colt foal out of old Honeysuckle I am going to
keep, and I shall send him to you at the back-end.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall be very pleased to have him,&quot; replied
May. &quot;What a wonder Honeysuckle was on the
turf, and at the stud she has been even a greater
success.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And that does not always follow,&quot; said the
Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By no means,&quot; replied the trainer. &quot;The
contrary is often the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The other horses at Stanton House were looked
over, and after luncheon the Squire and his son
returned to London, Eli going back to Hazelwell
by a different route.</p>

<p class="indent">On their way up to town Ulick gave his father
a full account of his doings since he left home;
and the Squire, in return, informed him of the
course of events at Hazelwell.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>&quot;If it had not been for Irene I should have
been still more lonely,&quot; he said. &quot;She was with
me last winter for some time, and cheered me up,
although I am rather afraid she was not particularly
happy herself. I wish you had fallen in love
with her instead of Warren, it would have been
a good thing for all of us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If he only knew how I loved her,&quot; thought
Ulick. Aloud he said, &quot;She ought to be happy.
Anselm Manor is a fine place, and her husband
has plenty of money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He had,&quot; remarked the Squire, &quot;but I do
not know whether it is the case now. He gambles
and is seldom at home. He had to sell Holme
Farm to pay his debts, it was the best part of the
estate. He had not the sense to offer it to me;
I would have given him half as much again as
he sold it for.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick was surprised to hear this; he knew
Warren Courtly was very well off, and his gambling
transactions must have been very heavy to
force him to sell Holme Farm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does Irene know of this?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, she cannot be kept in the dark. They
have not been married long, as you are aware, and
yet I am very much afraid she has found out her
mistake, and, what is worse, I encouraged her to
accept him. It has all been a deplorable bungle,
but I hope Warren will pull up in time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>They drove from Liverpool Street to the Walton
Hotel, and Ulick sent round to his rooms for his
clothes.</p>

<p class="indent">As he dressed for dinner he little thought that
Warren Courtly and Irene were to be of the party;
he was unaware of their presence in the hotel,
his father purposely not having mentioned it in
case it might drive him away.</p>

<p class="indent">It wanted half an hour to dinner-time, and he
opened the window and looked out across the
gardens, the Embankment, and the river. The
scene attracted him, although he had seen it many
times before; but the dull, dark beauty of the
Thames, as it flows through the great city to the
sea, possesses an irresistible fascination which
seldom palls. London and the Thames are bound
together by historical ties which can never be
undone. The great watery highway glides heavily
along under many vast bridges, past huge warehouses,
docks, and shipping from all parts of the
world, until it gradually empties itself into the
Channel, and is lost in the vast sea. Ulick knew
Paris well, and wondered why there were no
steamers plying along the Thames as they did on
the Seine. He thought it a shame this great river
should be thus neglected, for no more imposing
view of London can be obtained than from a
boat.</p>

<p class="indent">He carelessly watched the traffic on the Embankment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
and the people lounging on the seats
in the gardens below. London is always busy, and
yet it contains myriads of human beings whose
sole occupation is to kill time.</p>

<p class="indent">At the dinner-hour he went downstairs. His
father informed him he had engaged a table, and
the waiter pointed it out to him. He crossed over
and sat down. In a few minutes he saw his father
enter the room, and almost fell off his chair
in astonishment and dismay as he saw Warren
Courtly and Irene with him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a little surprise I have not exactly prepared
for you, but am giving you,&quot; said the Squire,
smiling. &quot;I have explained to them that we are
quite reconciled, and that there are no differences
between us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick shook hands mechanically with Warren
Courtly, who felt very uneasy, and Irene, who did
not conceal the pleasure it gave her to see him
again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is the best news I have heard since you left
Hazelwell,&quot; she said. &quot;I thought it too good to
be true when your father told me of your meeting
and reconciliation at Newmarket.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I am more than pleased to see you again,&quot;
he said, earnestly. &quot;You have not quite forgotten
your old playmate and companion?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no; I never can forget those days;
they were the happiest of my life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>She did not think what she was saying until
Warren said abruptly&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is not very complimentary to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene coloured slightly as she replied&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You understand what I mean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And heard what you said,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am very glad Irene was so happy at Hazelwell,&quot;
said the Squire. &quot;We always tried to make
her so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The conversation during dinner-time seemed to
drag; there was a feeling of restraint between the
three younger members of the party which the
Squire, who was overflowing with good-humoured
happiness, failed to notice. He talked freely and
well, and Ulick was glad of it. From time to time
he glanced at Warren and thought&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If he knew I had met Janet, and seen him
in Mrs. Hoffman's house at Feltham, I wonder
what he would do? He knows he has done me
an irreparable injury, and yet it does not seem to
trouble him much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After dinner Warren Courtly said he had letters
to write, and asked to be excused for half an hour.</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire went into the reading-room, &quot;Just
for a quiet doze,&quot; he said, smiling, and Irene
and Ulick were left alone. They went on to the
balcony and sat down. It was a beautiful May
evening, much warmer than usual, and the air
was refreshing after the heat of the room.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>&quot;You cannot know how the Squire has suffered
during your absence,&quot; she said, after a few remarks
on various topics. &quot;Do you not think he is older,
I mean has aged very much?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Ulick, &quot;and I am very sorry
if I have been the cause. Still, I could not
have acted otherwise. I would do it again if
necessary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She wished to ask him if his father believed in
him, knew he had accused him unjustly, but it
was a delicate matter. Still, they were old friends,
and there could be no harm in it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is the Squire satisfied he made a mistake,
and he was in the wrong?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I have that satisfaction, although I
cannot return to Hazelwell at present.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not return!&quot; she exclaimed, in surprise.
&quot;What reason can there possibly be for that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A grave reason which I cannot explain to you,
but which my father accepts, although he fails
to understand; may I ask you to do the same?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed, yes; but I am very, very sorry you
are not coming home,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad to hear you say that,&quot; he replied,
earnestly, &quot;because I value your good opinion
very much, almost as much, if not quite, as my
father's.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have always had my good opinion,&quot;
she said, softly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>&quot;Then you never believed me guilty?&quot; he
asked, eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">She hesitated; she had at one time thought he
might have become entangled with Janet. She
would not deny it now.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must forgive me, Ulick,&quot; she said.
&quot;Remember, I heard the story from the Squire,
and I had no opportunity of hearing your side.
What else could I do? I confess I thought as
he thought, but I no longer do so now you are
reconciled.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You thought me capable of stealing Janet
Todd from her father, from Eli, who would have
willingly done anything for me?&quot; he said, reproachfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not that; no, not that,&quot; she replied. &quot;I
never gave that a thought.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You did not believe Janet went away with
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I was sure she did not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked surprised, she spoke so certainly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why were you sure?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because Eli told me you left the house alone,
when Janet was in her room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did he know, he left us alone together
when he went out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was sure of it, and I believed what he
told me,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick thought Eli must know more about Janet's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
disappearance than he cared to tell. He did not
know where she was, but it was quite possible he
knew with whom she ran away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He spoke the truth,&quot; said Ulick. &quot;I did not
injure Janet in any way, nor did she leave home
with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder who she went with?&quot; said Irene.
&quot;Have you any idea?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How can I possibly know?&quot; he said,
evasively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, of course not,&quot; she replied. &quot;But I
cannot understand why you will not come back
to Hazelwell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly joined them. He heard his
wife's last remark, and remarked&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can have no reason for remaining away
now you and the Squire are reconciled.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have an excellent reason,&quot; said Ulick,
looking him straight in the face in a manner
that made him feel very uncomfortable.</p>

<h2><a name="CXIV" id="CXIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>A DISCOVERY IMMINENT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Warren Courtly</span> remained in London, and
his wife returned home with the Squire. Irene
was accustomed to his frequent absences from
the Manor, and became somewhat reconciled to
being alone. The Squire, however, was exceedingly
angry with him, and ventured to remonstrate,
but received no satisfaction from the interview;
on the contrary, it tended to widen the breach
between them.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick promised his father he would return to
Hazelwell as soon as circumstances permitted,
and the Squire stated his intention of coming at
the end of the month to see the Saint run in the
Coronation Cup at Epsom.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly had a serious quarrel with
Felix Hoffman over the letter he wrote to Irene.
Felix, however, was master of the situation, and
told him so.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know who you are, and that you have a
wife at Anselm Manor; I wonder how she would
take it if I introduced her to Mrs. Warren?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You dare not, you scoundrel,&quot; said Warren.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
&quot;I have never lived with Mrs. Warren, you know
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know she is no more Mrs. Warren than I
am, unless you have committed bigamy, which
is not at all likely,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you say one word to my wife about Mrs.
Warren and myself, you will repent it,&quot; said
Warren Courtly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I? Then you will have to make it
worth my while to hold my tongue,&quot; replied
Felix.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Turning blackmailer, are you?&quot; said Warren.
&quot;What is your price?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fifty pounds will carry me over this month,
and I promise not to trouble you if I have good
luck with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And supposing you have bad luck?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I am afraid I must trespass upon your
generosity again,&quot; replied Felix.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And how long will this sort of thing go on?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It all depends upon circumstances. I may
not require your assistance for some time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And if I refuse your request?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I shall feel it my duty to enlighten
Mrs. Courtly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was no way out of the fix, so he paid
Felix Hoffman fifty pounds, thankful to be able
to keep him quiet for a time, until he could think
over what was best to be done.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>Why did he not make a clean breast of it to
Irene? His folly was committed before he
married her, and she could not blame him for
attending to Janet's wants. It was shameful to
leave Ulick under suspicion. Then he thought,
&quot;But he is not under suspicion now. I wonder
why he does not go home. It is very curious.
He cannot have discovered anything about me,
that is almost impossible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick was half inclined to tax Warren with
being the cause of all the trouble, and would
have done so in all probability had a favourable
opportunity occurred. Fortunately it did
not, or angry words might have passed between
them, which would have led to a serious
quarrel.</p>

<p class="indent">Felix Hoffman had bad luck, and a few days
after he received the fifty pounds he lost it all,
and more with it. He had no hesitation in
asking for assistance, which Warren point-blank
refused.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see what you intend doing,&quot; he said, &quot;and
I do not mean to be bled. I will face the consequences,
and you can do your worst.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Felix Hoffman was taken by surprise at the
unexpectedly bold front shown, and said,
angrily&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, you know what will happen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you do not,&quot; replied Warren.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>&quot;I have a very good idea.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have told my wife everything, what do
you think of that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't believe it,&quot; said Felix, quaking lest
it should be true.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may please yourself about that,&quot;
Warren answered. &quot;I have no desire to speak to
you again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then out of my house Mrs. Warren, or whoever
she is, goes neck and crop.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Warren laughed provokingly, as he replied&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not your house, and if anyone goes it
will be yourself. I shall have great pleasure in
assisting your mother to get rid of you, and I
am sure it would be a relief to her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Felix Hoffman went home in a towering rage.
He owed a lot of money, and knew if he did
not pay up that the bookmakers would show him
scant courtesy. Some of them he had not treated
well in his more prosperous days, and they would
only be too glad to retaliate.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Hoffman knew her son's temper was none
of the best, and she saw he was in a bad humour.
He did not, however, mean to let her into his
secret as to the identity of Mr. Warren, nor
had he any desire that Janet should leave
the house; on the contrary, now he had calmed
down, he was sorry he hinted at such a thing to
Mr. Courtly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>He cudgelled his brains as to which was the
best way to obtain money. He repaid the loan of
five pounds to Mrs. Courtly in order to inspire her
with confidence in him; he would write again
and ask for a loan of five-and-twenty pounds;
it was not much but it would be useful as a stop-gap.</p>

<p class="indent">He was careful over the composition of the
letter, and anxiously awaited a reply. It came,
and there was no money enclosed.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Courtly wrote to the effect that her
husband had warned her against him as an unprincipled
cheat. She explained that she had
shown his former letters to him, and that was
his comment upon them. She had no desire to
hold further communication with him.</p>

<p class="indent">This roused Felix Hoffman, and his anger for
a time mastered him. He would make Warren
Courtly pay dearly for this, and give his wife a
shock she would not get over for a long time.</p>

<p class="indent">Janet little thought, as she sat reading a novel,
what was going on in the next room.</p>

<p class="indent">Felix seized pen and paper, and commenced
writing furiously. He read the letter when
finished, and found it ridiculous. He must
write in a calmer, more methodical and convincing
strain, or she would take no notice
of it.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>At the end of an hour he had composed something
that suited him. He could give her some
information about her husband, and his goings on
when in London, that would open her eyes, but he
must be well paid for it, and have a hundred
pounds down. He hinted that there was a lady
in the case who went under the name of Mrs.
Warren. &quot;She resides with my mother, whose
address I will send you if you forward me the
amount I have named. I assure you what I
write is true, and you can prove it for your own
satisfaction. I have seen Mr. Courtly there many
times with the lady named.&quot; There was more
to the same purpose. &quot;If that does not fetch
her, I'll never write another letter,&quot; he said, with
satisfaction at the thought that he was firing a
mine that would explode in a manner Warren
Courtly little dreamed of.</p>

<p class="indent">When Irene received the letter she was at
first inclined to tear it up, but curiosity prevailed,
and she read it. Her cheeks burned with anger.
How dare this scoundrel make such a charge
against Warren. Whatever he might do in the
way of gambling and spending money foolishly,
she was sure he would not deceive her as this
man suggested.</p>

<p class="indent">She read the letter again, and became more
uneasy. It was within her power to find out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
whether he had told her a lie or otherwise. Was it
a ruse to get a hundred pounds out of her? That
could hardly be the case, because the writer gave
his address and was known to Warren, who
could bring him to book for slandering him. She
thought over his constant absence from home,
his frequent visits to London, even when no
racing was going on, his increased expenditure.
Might not a portion of the money go in the
manner suggested? Irene had very little knowledge
of such matters, yet she had sense enough
to perceive that if Warren was entangled much
money would be required. She became restless
and excited. Something must be done, she could
not exist in this state of suspense. If Warren
had deceived her, she would never live with him
again.</p>

<p class="indent">Eventually she wrote, enclosing the amount
required, and requesting Mrs. Hoffman's
address.</p>

<p class="indent">Felix was delighted at the success of his
scheme, and sent the same address he had
given before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My mother lives with me,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and
Mrs. Warren is in the house. She is nearly always
at home; but if you call and she happens to be
out, my mother will attend to you. Ask to see
Mrs. Warren.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>&quot;Living in the same house,&quot; thought Irene,
&quot;then it must be true. Oh, how miserable
I am.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She made arrangements to go to London,
taking her maid with her, and requesting Mrs.
Dixon to inform Mr. Maynard of her departure.
&quot;Tell him I shall stay at the Walton with Warren,
and that we shall probably remain until after
Epsom week.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had no idea whether Warren was at the
Walton, or otherwise, because he always wrote
from his club. She thought of the scented paper
on which he had once written, and her heart
sank.</p>

<p class="indent">Mary Marley, her maid, was surprised, but
delighted at the prospect of a visit to London,
for it was some time since she had been there.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene was silent during the journey, and went
to bed early after dinner. Her maid was surprised
her master was not there, but she made no remark.
She knew her place. Next day Irene went out
alone. She drove to Waterloo and booked to
Feltham. Arriving at the station, she asked
for Mrs. Hoffman at the address given. The
porter directed her, and looked at her admiringly
as she left the station, as it was seldom he saw
such a stylishly dressed lady, and wondered who
she could be.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>Irene's heart beat painfully fast as she walked
slowly along the road. The house was not far
from the station the porter told her, and she
dreaded reaching it. She felt half inclined to
turn back. Perhaps it was some cunning trap
laid for her by this man. She had read of the
mysterious disappearances of women, and the
prospect was not pleasant. She did not lack
courage, and as she had come so far she would
not turn back.</p>

<p class="indent">She reached the house, opened the gate, and
rang the bell. Mrs. Hoffman opened the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does Mrs. Warren live here?&quot; asked Irene,
dreading her answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. She is out doing a little shopping at
present. Will you come in, my lady?&quot; said
Mrs. Hoffman, overwhelmed at the sight of such
expensive raiment and at Irene's aristocratic
features.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, I am anxious to see her,&quot; she
said, as she entered the house, feeling that her
life was about to be shattered, and all her fears
realised, before she left it again.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Hoffman opened the door of the front
room, and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is Mrs. Warren's sitting-room; I am
sure she will not be long.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene thanked her and sat down. As she did
not seem inclined to talk, Mrs. Hoffman discreetly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
withdrew, although she would dearly have
loved to linger and gossip.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene looked round the room curiously. It
was neatly furnished, but there was nothing to
give her a clue as to the identity of its occupier,
nor did she see anything indicative of Warren's
frequent presence in the house. She was relieved
at this; after all, there might be some mistake,
and she could apologise and leave. She would
willingly have given another hundred pounds
to find out she had been deceived by Felix
Hoffman, and allowed him to go scot free into
the bargain.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene moved about the room looking at sundry
books and papers lying about on the table. She
saw no signs of work-basket, or anything to
indicate that Mrs. Warren was industrious, and
again her hopes sank.</p>

<p class="indent">Time passed slowly, and she commenced to
feel uneasy. She was inclined to leave the
house. She rang the bell and Mrs. Hoffman
appeared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think Mrs. Warren will be much
longer?&quot; she asked. &quot;Perhaps I had better call
again, but as I came from London I am anxious to
see her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expected her in before this,&quot; said Mrs.
Hoffman. &quot;Perhaps you had better wait as you
have come so far.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>&quot;Will Mr. Warren be with her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear no; he seldom comes now,&quot; said
Mrs. Hoffman.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene was thankful for this; it was a grain
of comfort, and she anxiously caught at any
straw.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They do not live together,&quot; said the gossiping
woman, &quot;but the separation is by mutual consent.
They quarrel occasionally when he is here,
and he always seems glad to get away. Mrs.
Warren is a nice lady, I like her very much, but
of course you know her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course,&quot; echoed Irene.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And her husband?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder who she is?&quot; thought Mrs. Hoffman.
&quot;She's not in the same circle as Mrs.
Warren, that's certain. How did she find out the
address?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Warren sent you her address I suppose?&quot;
asked Mrs. Hoffman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I knew it,&quot; was Irene's answer, &quot;or I should
not have been here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Hoffman felt it would be indiscreet to
put further questions on this matter. She heard
the gate click and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expect this is Mrs. Warren. I will mention
you are here. What name, please, my
lady?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>&quot;Do not tell her anyone has called to
see her,&quot; replied Irene, hastily, &quot;it will be
a pleasant surprise for her, as she does not
expect me.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CXV" id="CXV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>THE RESULT OF THE DISCOVERY.</h3>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">You</span> have been a long time,&quot; said Mrs. Hoffman
to Janet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I went for a walk through the Park; it is
such a nice morning,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene heard her voice and started at the sound.
It was familiar. Where had she heard it before?
She felt she was on the verge of a startling discovery,
and became agitated. She determined
not to appear at a disadvantage, and therefore
controlled her feelings.</p>

<p class="indent">Janet entered, unaware there was anyone in
the room, and as Irene was hidden from view
behind the opened door she did not see her.
She walked to the table to put down a parcel and
Irene saw her. At first she was too bewildered
to speak; then she said sharply&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Janet, what are you doing here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Janet Todd looked round, frightened and
startled at the unexpected question. When she
saw Irene she staggered back and sank into a
chair, covered with shame and confusion. She
made no answer, and Irene stood looking at her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
still unable to grasp the full meaning of the
situation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How is it you are living here?&quot; she asked.
&quot;Are you a friend of Mrs. Hoffman or Mrs.
Warren?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Janet looked at her with tears in her eyes, and
said, in a broken voice&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, why have you come here? Please go
away and leave me; I am a miserable, wretched
woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was far from Irene's intention to leave her
without learning the truth. The appearance of
Janet was totally unexpected, and she could not
account for it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall not leave you until you tell me
why you are in this house, and who induced
you to leave your home. I know it was not Mr.
Maynard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was not; he is a good, brave man, and
would never wrong any woman,&quot; said Janet. &quot;I
cannot tell you why I am here&mdash;I dare not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was told to ask for Mrs. Warren. Where is
she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who told you to ask for her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That does not matter.&quot; Then it suddenly
occurred to her that Janet might be Mrs. Warren,
and the thought seemed to freeze the blood in
her veins. She came forward and, bending over
her, said in a low voice&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>&quot;You are not Mrs. Warren, are you? Tell me
you are not, Janet, for pity's sake.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She made no reply, but sobbed convulsively,
her body shook, and she shivered painfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you Mrs. Warren?&quot; asked Irene again,
in a tone which demanded an answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; faintly sobbed Janet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Mr. Warren is my husband. Janet,
how could you do me such a bitter wrong? I
have always been your friend,&quot; said Irene.</p>

<p class="indent">Despite the trouble and confusion she was in,
Janet saw there was a misunderstanding, and
she must do all in her power to make the best of
things.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not wrong you,&quot; said Janet. &quot;I ran
away with Mr. Courtly before you were married
to him. If there be any wrong, you did it to me
by taking the place I ought to have occupied.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene started; Janet was putting a different
complexion on the case.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So it was my husband who induced you to
leave your home?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and he promised to marry me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you believed him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you leave your father's house with him
the night Mr. Maynard had the quarrel about
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>&quot;You saw him that night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and he told me everything, but forbid
me to speak about it to the Squire. He was very
angry, and said his father had no right to accuse
him, and that he would not return to Hazelwell
until he asked his forgiveness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you tell him you had arranged to leave
home with Mr. Courtly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I dare not; he would have told my
father, and I should have been detained.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you have known all this time that suspicion
rested upon Mr. Maynard, and that he
was suspected of having gone away with you?&quot;
asked Irene.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is so, but he has forbidden me to speak
about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He knows you are here!&quot; exclaimed Irene.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Promise you will not mention it to anyone,
and I will tell you all,&quot; said Janet.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene sat down and, as she did so, said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I promise I will not mention what you
tell me to anyone but my husband, will that
satisfy you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why inform him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I may find it necessary,&quot; said Irene.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will be better not to do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am the best judge of that,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p class="indent">Janet then gave Irene a full account of her
life since leaving home with Warren Courtly, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
how Ulick had called to see her, after accidentally
catching sight of her in Feltham, and of his
presence in the house when Warren Courtly
called.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Maynard knows all?&quot; exclaimed Irene,
in consternation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everything,&quot; replied Janet, &quot;and he was most
anxious you should not discover the truth. He
will be very angry if he finds out I have told you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then it was to save her pain and shame Ulick
had allowed the blame to rest upon his shoulders,
knowing at the same time her husband was
guilty. Why had he done this for her sake?
Her heart answered her, and she knew he loved
her and that she loved him. What a mistake
it had all been. The Squire had blundered, and
Ulick had thrown away his chance of happiness
and her own by his hasty conduct. It was done,
and could not be undone, and she must bear it
as well as she was able. How she wished Janet
had told him, the night he left Hazelwell, that
she was about to leave her home with Warren
Courtly. Ulick would have prevented it, and
everything would have been so different.</p>

<p class="indent">It was some time before she spoke; then she
asked&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is my husband to you now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing,&quot; said Janet, colouring. &quot;Since he
married you we have lived entirely apart. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
can believe what I say. I have no love for him,
he has none for me. He makes me an allowance,
which he has a right to do. We are not even
good friends, and I do not care if I never see him
again. I was a vain, foolish girl when I ran away
with him, and have bitterly repented it ever
since. Mr. Maynard told me my father was
anxious for me to return home, and he strongly
advised me to do so, until he discovered who
Mr. Warren was; then for your sake he bade
me keep silent and remain where I am.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene was somewhat relieved at this. From
Janet's statement she gathered her husband had
been faithful to her since their marriage, and
that, to a great extent, condoned his offence
towards herself, but she could not forgive him
for so cowardly allowing the blame to rest upon
Ulick. The contrast between the two came
vividly before her. Her husband hiding his
wrongs by sacrificing a friend; Ulick Maynard
knowingly bearing the blame to shield her from
sorrow and shame. She felt sorely tempted to
go to Ulick, fling herself into his arms, and ask
him to take her away from it all. She knew he
would resist this temptation for her sake, and
after a moment's consideration she also knew
it was impossible for her to act in such a manner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We must keep this interview to ourselves,&quot;
said Irene. &quot;No one must know of my visit, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
you must tell Mrs. Hoffman I am a friend, any
name will suffice to satisfy her. I am very sorry
for you, Janet, and advise you to return to your
father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot. Mr. Maynard made me promise
not to do so until he gave me permission, and I
could not face the people in Helton after what
has happened.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will live that down,&quot; said Irene. &quot;I
will take care no one talks about you, as far as I
am able, and I can do a good deal to help you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is very kind of you,&quot; replied Janet, &quot;and
I hope some day to see my father and live with
him again. I am not so bad, and I have
kept myself respectable since I ran away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I quite believe that,&quot; replied Irene. &quot;Do
you think my husband will call here again?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hardly know; he has posted me money
lately. I have no desire to see him,&quot; replied
Janet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will oblige me by not seeing him,&quot; said
Irene. &quot;Forbid him the house. If you require
money write to me, and I will send it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He might see the letter and recognise my
handwriting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is of no consequence. If he does he will
soon learn I have seen you and know everything,&quot;
said Irene.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will write and tell him I wish him to keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
away from the house, and I feel sure he will do
as I desire,&quot; said Janet.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene remained some time longer, for they had
much to talk about. When she was leaving Janet
said she would write to her at once if there was
anything of importance she thought she ought
to know.</p>

<p class="indent">When Irene returned to the Walton, her maid
told her Warren Courtly had called, and was very
angry when he discovered his wife had come up
to London without informing him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The manager told him you were here,&quot; said
Mary. &quot;I expect he thought he had come to
see you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you see Mr. Courtly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and he asked me where you had gone.
I told him I did not know, but that I expected
you back in the afternoon, and he said he would
be here for dinner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene went to her room, and after dismissing
her maid thought over the best course to pursue.
Should she tell him of her meeting with Janet,
and that she had learned everything, or would
it be better to leave him in the dark? What
excuse could she give for her journey to London?
State she had come to give him a pleasant surprise,
and that the Squire would be there in a
day or two for the Epsom week. Perhaps that
would be the better plan. If he was unreasonably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
cross and irritable, she might possibly throw out
a hint that would startle him and make him
more careful.</p>

<p class="indent">It was four o'clock, and she did not expect him
for dinner before seven, so there was ample time
to review the eventful morning she had spent
with Janet Todd. This she was doing when her
maid knocked at the door and said Mr. Ulick
Maynard had called to see her.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene did not expect him, his father must have
written at once to inform him she had gone to
town.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is he?&quot; asked Irene.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the reading-room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will see him in my sitting-room,&quot; she said;
and her maid went away to give the necessary
instruction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad to see you,&quot; said Ulick, as she
entered the room. &quot;It is an unexpected pleasure.
I had no idea you were in town until my father
wrote me a hurried note.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shook hands with him, and as she did
so the thought that he knew what her husband
had done, and how he had acted, caused her
some confusion, at which Ulick wondered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I came to town to give Warren a surprise,&quot;
she said, hurriedly. &quot;I have not seen him yet,
but he has called, and my maid says he did not
seem overwhelmed with joy at my presence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>&quot;Then he ought to have been,&quot; said Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is joining me at dinner. Will you make
one of the party?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you wish it, and you think he will have
no objection?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sure he will be pleased to see you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In that case I have no hesitation in accepting.
I will run home and dress.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">How lovely Irene looked; he felt he must
go away, leave her presence, or he would be
tempted to betray his feelings. He little knew
how strongly she controlled herself, and how
deeply she loved him. It was well for them that
it should be so.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly's temper had not improved
when he arrived again at the Walton. He went
to Irene's room and waited impatiently for her,
and she did not keep him long.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What brings you to town in such a hurry?&quot;
he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I felt lonely and thought I would give you
a surprise,&quot; she said, with a faint smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You had no business to come without first
writing me about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I saw no harm in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Harm, no; but it is a strange proceeding on
your part,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you not pleased to see me?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I am,&quot; he answered, testily. &quot;It's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
the manner of your coming I do not approve
of.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will soon recover from the shock,&quot; she
said, carelessly. &quot;Shall we dine at seven. I have
invited Ulick Maynard to join us. He called this
afternoon, and I thought it only polite. He
accepted on condition you had no objection, and
I said you would be very pleased to see him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly with difficulty suppressed an
oath. Of late he had avoided Ulick, and he was
the last man he cared to meet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would rather have had you to myself,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ulick is such an old friend, he will make no
difference,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are precious fond of his society still,&quot; he
said, showing his ill-temper; &quot;I should have
thought you would have preferred being alone
with me, if you came down to give me a surprise.
Perhaps you wrote and informed him you were
coming here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene was angry at this remark, and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know I did no such thing, and I am
surprised at you insulting me by such a remark.
His father wrote and gave him the information.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At your suggestion,&quot; sneered Warren.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are in a bad temper, and forget yourself,&quot;
she replied. &quot;I will leave you to recover
your manners. Remember one thing, if you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
make any more suggestions of a similar kind at
dinner I shall retaliate. I am quite capable of
giving you a very unpleasant surprise if you fail
to treat me with respect.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She went out of the room, and he stood looking
at the closed door. Then he said to himself&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What has come over her? I never found
her in this mood before. I must get to the bottom
of it. Retaliate, will she? Well, we shall see.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CXVI" id="CXVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>A RACE TO BE REMEMBERED.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not a social meal, anything but that, and
they were glad when it was over. Warren Courtly,
irritable and ill at ease, spoke once or twice
to his wife in such a manner that Ulick
glared at him savagely; he noticed it, and
enjoyed it.</p>

<p class="indent">Unfortunately, Warren was going from bad
to worse. He realised the truth of the saying
that evil communications corrupt good manners.
At his club he played bridge and lost large sums.
On the racecourse he tried to repair these
losses, with the inevitable result. His fortune,
at one time ample, gradually dwindled away,
and he knew that if he did not pull up Anselm
Manor would be in the market in a couple of
years or so.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene had no idea things were as bad as this;
her mind was occupied with other matters. The
knowledge she possessed of her husband's conduct
towards Janet Todd and Ulick she found
burdensome. She was positively certain Ulick
would not tell the Squire, and she felt he ought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
to know, but she had promised Janet to tell no
one but her husband. When she left them to
retire for the night, Warren commenced to talk
about racing. He had a substantial bet about
Sandstone for the Derby at very fair odds, and
was sanguine of winning. He discussed the race
with Ulick, who was of the same opinion that
Sandstone would win.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If he does,&quot; Ulick remarked, &quot;I should put
part of the winnings on my horse for the Coronation
Cup.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your horse!&quot; exclaimed Warren. &quot;I had
no idea you owned one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;More than one&mdash;several,&quot; replied Ulick;
&quot;but the Saint is the best.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You own the Saint!&quot; said Warren, more
and more surprised. &quot;I have heard it said he is
the best three-year-old we have.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is not far short of it,&quot; he replied. &quot;At
least, that is the opinion of Fred May, and he is
a very good judge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are lucky to own such a colt. Where
did you pick him up?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick explained how he came to possess him,
and Warren said, grumbling, that some people
had all the luck.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been deuced unfortunate of late,&quot; he
went on, &quot;and a big win is the only way out of
the difficulty that I can see. If Sandstone lands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
the Derby I will have a plunge on your horse.
I am much obliged to you for telling me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall be glad to hear of your winning a good
round sum,&quot; replied Ulick. &quot;I was sorry to
hear you were compelled to part with Holme
Farm.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Warren's face clouded. He had heard quite
enough about that, and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't see what there is to make such a fuss
about. Something had to go; why not that part
of the estate as well as another?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My father says he would have given you half
as much again for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could not have accepted it; he would
merely have done it out of kindness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick thought this probable, and knew his father
would do that, and more, for Irene's sake.</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire arrived at the Walton, and was
feverishly anxious for the Saint's race to be decided.
Fred May had sent glowing accounts of the colt's
progress, and considered he had a chance second
to none.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will show them what he is capable of this
time; it will be the race of his life. He has never
been quite so fit as he is now, and I fear nothing,
not even Vulture,&quot; he wrote.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By Jove! that is good news,&quot; said the
Squire. &quot;The olive green will win, my boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On Derby Day they all went to Epsom, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
Redmond Maynard had a box, and the great
scene was repeated as it has been for many
years.</p>

<p class="indent">It was one of the sights of the world, most uncomfortable,
but unique.</p>

<p class="indent">Sandstone won somewhat easily, and Warren
was jubilant. He meant to invest the bulk of
his winnings on the Saint.</p>

<p class="indent">He confided to Irene that if Ulick's colt won
his difficulties would be well-nigh at an end.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had no idea you were in difficulties,&quot; she
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not very serious,&quot; he replied, in an off-hand
manner, which did not deceive her, &quot;but still
bad enough to be unpleasant.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thursday, the day after the Derby, was fixed
for the Coronation Cup, and the half-dozen
horses that were likely to go to the post were all
great performers.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a meeting of champions, a race to be
remembered, and a thorough sporting affair.
The crowd was much larger than usual on this day,
and the race was looked forward to with as much
eagerness as the Derby had been the previous
day.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly was in a fever of excitement.
He had backed the Saint to win him several
thousands, and when he saw him in the paddock
felt inclined to put more on.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>The colt's peculiar colour rendered him easily
distinguishable, and he was mobbed in the
paddock, taking it as unconcernedly as usual.</p>

<p class="indent">Ben Sprig was to ride him again, and he felt
a trifle anxious as to the result. He had never
been beaten on the Saint, having scored five
victories in succession; but he knew the five
horses he was to meet in about a quarter of an
hour were probably the best in the country.</p>

<p class="indent">Vulture had won the Derby the previous year,
as easily as Sandstone, and followed it up by a
St. Leger victory. Coralie, a handsome mare,
had an Ascot Gold Cup to her credit. Avenger
made hacks of the last Cesarewitch field. Decoy
Duck was an Eclipse winner; and Mermaid
landed the Oaks in Vulture's year. Well
might men gasp and exclaim, &quot;What a field.
It beats the Derby into a cocked hat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No wonder the betting was fast and furious,
and backers were split up into half-a-dozen parties.
It was the more venturesome speculators who
stood by the Saint. The old hands preferred one
of the other tried stayers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is too much to expect of him,&quot; they said
of the Saint. &quot;It's more than Sandstone
could do, and look how he won the Derby
yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Vulture was favourite, then Coralie and Avenger,
and the Saint figured at eight to one.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>&quot;It is a real good price,&quot; said the Squire. &quot;I
must have a hundred on,&quot; and when he had booked
that he longed for more, hesitated a moment
or two, and then doubled it.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene caught the fever and made Warren put a
&quot;pony&quot; on for her.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick had a small amount going, and Warren
had plunged.</p>

<p class="indent">Cautious Fred May departed from his usual
custom of having &quot;a tenner on&quot; and invested
fifty, and had done the same for Ben Sprig, who
was not supposed to indulge in such iniquitous
practices, for fear of the far-reaching arm of the
stewards of the Jockey Club. Ben was a cautious
man, and could conscientiously say he had never
made a wager in his life&mdash;it was always done for
him.</p>

<p class="indent">Great was the excitement as the horses went
on to the course. Vulture, wearing the stars and
stripes of his American owner, was first out, his
jockey sitting crouched on his withers&mdash;an ugly
sight, but often effective. Then came the handsome
Coralie, in purple and scarlet, followed by
Avenger's yellow and red cap, with Decoy Duck
and Mermaid close behind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There's only five of 'em,&quot; said one spectator.
&quot;Where's the other? What is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Saint, of course; Ben Sprig's up, he's
always last out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>The Saint cantered slowly down as the others
galloped past, and Ben, whipping him round,
followed in the rear before half the onlookers
were aware the colt had come out of the
paddock.</p>

<p class="indent">Away they went to the famous Derby starting-post.
Here Vulture showed his scant respect for
decorum by lashing out all round, and in a final
flourish tried to dash through the tapes, but did
not succeed.</p>

<p class="indent">After a quarter of an hour wasted by these
vagaries on the part of the favourite, the half-dozen
started on their journey.</p>

<p class="indent">Coralie dashed off with the lead, followed by
Vulture and Avenger, with the other three close up.
It was evident it was to be a race from start to
finish between the lot. They disappeared from
view, and as they came in sight again, the
mare still led, and the horses ran wide. The
half-dozen were all on terms with each other.
Tattenham Corner was reached and the crowd on
the new stand cheered wildly as they swept past.
It was here that Ben Sprig always looked out for
a chance of gaining a few lengths. He wanted
them more than ever on this occasion, and meant
getting them if possible. He hugged the rails,
and kept the Saint well in hand. He lost no ground
but he gained none, as they were all adopting
similar tactics, and none of the horses ran wide.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
The half-dozen seemed dangerously heaped together
as they rounded the bend, and the crowd
on that part of the course anticipated a spill, but
happily it did not occur. Coralie led down the hill,
the purple and gold glittering and shining royally
in the sunlight.</p>

<p class="indent">The party in the Squire's box were unusually
excited, which was not to be wondered at. Fred
May was invited to join them, and he was more
anxious than he had ever been before over the
result of a race.</p>

<p class="indent">He had said he &quot;feared nothing,&quot; with the
Saint, and meant it. If he had a dread of one, it
was Vulture, for he knew him to be a great horse,
despite his temper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They keep their places,&quot; said the Squire,
&quot;but I fancy the Saint is drawing up a
trifle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly was very pale, and his hand
shook as he held his glasses. Irene glanced at
him, and thought&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Much depends on this race, or he would not
be like that.&quot; She turned to Ulick, who stood
at her side, and said, &quot;You take it coolly, are
you confident of winning?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I think he will win; I know Ben is riding
a splendid race, and saving him for the finish up
the rise. That is where it tells.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do hope he will win, Ulick,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>He looked into her eyes and read more than he
dared hope for.</p>

<p class="indent">Coralie had run well, but now they were racing
in deadly earnest.</p>

<p class="indent">Vulture wrested the lead from her, and his
giant stride told its tale. He shot out like
a greyhound, and a great shout greeted the
favourite's move. Avenger was close on his heels,
and Ben was gradually creeping up with the Saint.</p>

<p class="indent">They were in the hollow now, in full view of the
crowded stands, and the battle was watched with
the greatest interest.</p>

<p class="indent">Not more than five lengths between the six
horses&mdash;a sight seldom seen in such a race.
Decoy Duck and Mermaid were in the rear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid he will hardly do it,&quot; said the
Squire, &quot;but what a race it is; there will be no
disgrace in being beaten.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly bit his lip and looked desperate.
Would the Saint get up and win? It seemed
impossible; and yet the trainer and Ulick looked
confident, so there must be a chance. The victory
of Ulick's horse meant much to him, of his defeat
he dare not think.</p>

<p class="indent">Seething with excitement, the vast crowd
surged wildly, and roar after roar proclaimed the
desperate nature of the struggle.</p>

<p class="indent">Ben Sprig knew the time had come when he
must ask the Saint to go one better than he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
ever done before. He knew what a good colt he
was, he never doubted his courage, but in front of
him was Vulture, a more than ordinary Derby
winner, Avenger, the Newmarket crack, and the
handsome Coralie. He knew he had the Ascot
Cup winner at his mercy, he fancied Avenger would
have to play second fiddle to the Saint, but what
about Vulture? Would he be able to catch him,
and, if he did, beat him? For the first time since
he had ridden the Saint he doubted. Vulture was
three lengths ahead, and striding along without
a falter. It seemed almost impossible to catch him,
but Ben knew the impossible often became the
possible with a good horse. Win he must; the
Saint should not lower his colours; the olive
green should never strike to the stars and stripes,
and he, Ben Sprig, the exponent of the old school
of riding, would not succumb to the efforts of
that crouching little Yankee in front of him.
Ben felt the blood tingle in his veins, and his
heart beat fast.</p>

<p class="indent">The Saint felt his grip, and knew it meant
mischief. The colt was full of fire, he never had
flinched, and he never would.</p>

<p class="indent">Who that saw it will ever forget that memorable
moment on a memorable day? Who that heard
them will forget the ringing cheers, the shouts of
victory? Who forget the sight of that flash of
olive green, which seemed to shoot forward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
with lightning speed? Ben Sprig fancied he was
being hurled through space; even he had never
expected this of the Saint.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick's colt passed Coralie like a flash, drew level
with Avenger, beat him, and ran up to the
Vulture's quarters before people had time to
grasp the wonderful feat.</p>

<p class="indent">Fred May shouted for joy; he forgot he was a
trainer, and therefore expected to regard everything
as a matter of course. Ulick shouted, the
Squire waved his hat, Warren Courtly sat down,
the strain was too great, and Irene felt a peculiar
swimming sensation in her head.</p>

<p class="indent">Vulture's jockey was not caught napping&mdash;Americans
seldom are&mdash;and he rode his best,
but he had met his match. The grim determination
of the elder man was not to be denied. Ben
Sprig felt his honour was at stake, he must
&quot;beat this kid.&quot; The two magnificent thoroughbreds
struggled desperately, they fought for
victory as only &quot;blue bloods&quot; can, and they knew
what it all meant as well as the riders. There is
no sight in the world so thrilling as the final
struggle of two gallant racehorses; it is the
highest form of sport, the most soul-stirring
scene a man can behold; he becomes part and
parcel of the battle going on before his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Vulture and the Saint were level, the stars and
stripes and the olive green were locked together.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
Only for a second or two it lasted, and then Ulick's
colt gained the vantage, and &quot;Mr. Lanark's&quot;
champion won the Coronation Cup by a short head,
after one of the grandest struggles ever witnessed
on any course.</p>

<h2><a name="CXVII" id="CXVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>THE SQUIRE OVERHEARS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Saint's wonderful victory was the chief topic
of conversation for the remainder of the afternoon,
and it was discussed all over the course. It was
acknowledged to have surpassed the Derby
victory of Sandstone, and the merits of the pair
were a fruitful source of conversation. Perhaps
Warren Courtly had as much reason to rejoice as
anyone over the Saint's win, for he had landed a
large stake. He left the box and went into the
ring, where he met several acquaintances, who
congratulated him.</p>

<p class="indent">Felix Hoffman stood alone in the paddock, his
face gloomy and desperate. He had been hard
hit again, his bad luck stuck to him, and he had
lost the hundred pounds he received from Irene.
He had plunged on Vulture and lost, and cursed
&quot;the curiosity&quot; for beating him.</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire and his companions went down to
the paddock to see the winner, and congratulate
Ben Sprig.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren was not with them, but he followed
later on.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>Ulick and Irene returned to the box, as she
was anxious to sit down and rest after the excitement
of the race.</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire stood talking with the trainer
and Ben Sprig, and Warren Courtly was coming
towards them when he encountered Felix Hoffman.</p>

<p class="indent">He tried to avoid him, but Felix was in a
desperate plight, and meant to obtain assistance
somehow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Had any luck?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Warren.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm dead broke; lend me a tenner to try
and get a bit back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a farthing,&quot; replied Warren, who moved
on, but stopped when he found Felix Hoffman
following him, and said, angrily&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go away, I will have nothing to do with
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must help me; I have done a lot of
dirty work for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Warren was losing his temper, and his eyes had
an angry gleam in them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you pester me I shall give you in charge;
go away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still Felix held his ground, and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I only ask for a trifle; it will pay you to
give it me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>&quot;Get out of my way or I will knock you down,&quot;
was the reply.</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire, walking across the paddock talking
to Ben Sprig, was so engrossed he failed to notice
them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Knock me down, will you?&quot; said Felix.
&quot;I'd like to see you do it. If you don't do as I
ask, I'll go straight to your wife and tell her all
about your dealings with Mrs. Warren. She's
here; I saw her in the box with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Warren raised his hand and in another moment
would have struck him, but the Squire heard the
words, and held his arm back in time to prevent
the blow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is this fellow?&quot; asked the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Felix Hoffman is my name, at your
service.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know him?&quot; he said to Warren.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes; he knows me very well,&quot; answered
Felix.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did not address you,&quot; replied the Squire;
and repeated his question.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren nodded as he said, &quot;Unfortunately
I do; he is a regular scoundrel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not as bad as you,&quot; was Felix's retort.
&quot;I haven't got one wife; you have two.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does the man mean?&quot; asked the
Squire.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>&quot;He's a fool, or worse; come away from
him,&quot; said Warren, &quot;or I shall do him an
injury.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know who you are,&quot; said Felix,
addressing the Squire; &quot;but if you are his father-in-law
I can tell you he is a bad lot. His wife,
Mrs. Warren, lives with my mother, and that is
the address; you can call and see for yourself,&quot;
he said, as he handed him a card.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren snatched it out of his hand and tore
it up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give me another card,&quot; said the Squire, and
Felix handed one to him, Warren not daring to
interfere on this occasion.</p>

<p class="indent">They moved away from Felix Hoffman, and
the Squire said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the meaning of this? Is there any
truth in it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's a confounded liar,&quot; said Warren,
angrily.</p>

<p class="indent">Felix Hoffman heard him, and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not. If you want to learn the truth,
ask his wife; she knows all about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Warren stepped up to him in fury, struck him
a heavy blow on the mouth, and knocked him
down.</p>

<p class="indent">Fortunately a race was being run at the time,
and there were only a few people in the paddock.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
The Squire forced Warren away with him, and
they left Felix sprawling on the grass.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You ought not to have struck him,&quot; said
the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He deserved it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was there any truth in what he said?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, none whatever. It is true I have been
to his house, and that a Mrs. Warren lives there,
but I have nothing to do with her, you may
rest assured of that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He said Irene knew all about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which is absurd, because there is nothing
to know. That is the man who wrote the begging-letter
Irene showed you, and you said the matter
ought to be placed in the hands of the police.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The scoundrel; he deserves all he got and
more,&quot; said the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren was relieved at this change of front,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He once gave me a winner at Hurst Park, and
he has pestered me for money ever since. He
was asking me to lend him ten pounds just before
you came up. It was because I refused he
trumped up this story about Mrs. Warren. It
is all a fabrication.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad to hear it,&quot; answered the Squire,
not quite satisfied.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren went into the ring, and when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
Squire entered the box Ulick left Irene in his
charge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have had rather an unpleasant scene in
the paddock,&quot; said the Squire; &quot;that fellow
Hoffman, who wrote to you, insulted Warren,
and he knocked him down. It served him
right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene turned pale and said, in an agitated
voice&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did he say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Told a pack of lies about Warren and some
woman living at his house. I don't believe a
word of it,&quot; said the Squire. &quot;He gave me his
address and told me to go and find out for myself.
Here it is,&quot; and he handed her the card.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene was in desperate straits. He must be
prevented from visiting Mrs. Hoffman's house at
any cost.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, you will take no notice of it,&quot; she
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The fellow actually said you knew all about
it, but I did not believe him. By gad, if I thought
Warren had deceived you I would make things
hot for him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has not deceived me,&quot; she replied.
&quot;Please do me a favour; take no further notice
of the matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Warren snatched the first card he offered me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
out of his hand. Why did he do that?&quot; asked
the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No doubt he thought it an insult for him to
offer it to you,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That may have been the reason. I hope so,&quot;
he replied.</p>

<p class="indent">A feeling of depression seemed to have come
over them, and Ulick, who had returned,
said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid the excitement has been too
much for you all. Shall we go home, there are
only two more races?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They readily agreed, with the exception of
Warren, who said he would see it out and return
after the last race.</p>

<p class="indent">This irritated the Squire, but he made no
remark, and they left him to his own devices.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren immediately sent a telegram to Janet
telling her to go away at once, as the Squire had
her address.</p>

<p class="indent">Janet was surprised at this, but she wondered
still more when another wire came from Irene to
the same effect, and asking her to send an address
to the Walton.</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire, however, had no intention of going
to Feltham, and when he returned to Hazelwell
Janet went back to Mrs. Hoffman's.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly felt he had better make a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
clean breast of it. He would tell Irene all, and
trust to her generosity to forgive him.</p>

<p class="indent">A week after the races, when they had returned
to Anselm Manor, Warren Courtly said to his
wife&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Irene, I have something to tell you: it is
humiliating for me to have to confess that I have
done wrong, and it will cause you pain to hear
my story.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She knew what he was about to say, but thought
it better to allow him to tell his own story. She
was glad he made her his confidante, and confessed
his fault. She felt she could almost forgive
him. To love him was impossible, for her heart
was not in her own keeping.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You recollect when Janet Todd disappeared
from home?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Ulick Maynard was, and still is by many
people, suspected of wronging her,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He did not wrong her, he is perfectly innocent.
It was before I became on intimate terms
with you that I was infatuated with Janet.
She was pretty and attracted me, and gradually
we drifted together, until we became more than
mere friends. I persuaded her to leave home and
go to London. She is there now, and I have never
deserted her, or let her want for anything. When
I knew you, Irene, and loved you, I severed all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
connection with Janet, and we have been almost
strangers to each other ever since our marriage.
Can you forgive me for what I have done? It
would have been unpardonable had I continued
to see Janet, but I have only done so when she
requested more money than I thought necessary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He felt relieved now he had told her, and waited
for her reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have not much to forgive,&quot; she said. &quot;It is
Ulick Maynard who has been wronged. You
must tell the Squire all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never,&quot; he exclaimed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I shall be compelled to do so, to clear
Ulick. That reparation you owe him, if not
more,&quot; she said, firmly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would not have told you had I thought you
would act like this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was needless; I knew all. I have seen
Janet, and she has confessed everything to me,&quot;
was Irene's reply.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked amazed. &quot;You have seen her!&quot;
he exclaimed. &quot;How did you find her out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Felix Hoffman sent me her address, for a
consideration.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you have been spying on me, playing
the lady detective. I am much obliged to
you, and am sorry I confessed my fault,&quot; he
said, sneeringly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>&quot;When you confessed I admired you for it;
you are changing my opinion of you,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I forbid you to tell the Squire. Perhaps
you would like to confide in Ulick, you appear
to be very good friends?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would be useless, he already knows everything,&quot;
she said, quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly felt decidedly small, but he
hardly believed her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He knows nothing,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He does, for he was in her house on one occasion
when you called to see Janet. He heard
her story, and for my sake forbade her to speak
of it, or return home,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For your sake,&quot; he said, sarcastically. &quot;Did
he tell you this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; Ulick is far too honourable for that,&quot;
she replied, hotly. &quot;He is not mean or underhand.
Janet gave me the information.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which, no doubt, you were glad to receive,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was, for it proved there was at least one
man in the world who thought me worthy of
sacrifices on his part,&quot; she answered, bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If he knows I took Janet away, why does he
not tell his father?&quot; asked Warren.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will never tell him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because he loves you?&quot; said Warren.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>&quot;And if he does?&quot; she asked, proudly.
&quot;What then? Am I not worthy to be loved by
a good man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you return his love?&quot; he asked, savagely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed harshly, as he replied&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you have no cause to complain of my
conduct with Janet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You degrade yourself and me by speaking
in that manner. You know that Ulick has no
knowledge that I love him, or is aware that I
know he loves me. I am your wife and will
do my duty. You will have no cause to
complain, all the wrong is on your side,&quot; she
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell the Squire if you like,&quot; he said. &quot;Only
remember, if you do I shall sell Anselm Manor and
leave the country, and you will go with me.
You are my wife, and must obey me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is a threat you will never carry out,&quot;
she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will; so you can think it over. There is
another thing I wish to mention. If you inform
the Squire, I will make matters very unpleasant
for yourself and Ulick. I have ample grounds for
suspicion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not deign to answer him, but walked
proudly out of the room.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>&quot;So he knows,&quot; thought Warren, moodily.
&quot;What a coward he must think me. I'll prove
to him I am not one before this year is out, how
or when I do not know, but I'll do it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He went into the stable yard and mounted a
horse that stood ready saddled.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene saw him ride away at a breakneck pace,
and wondered where he was going. After all, he
was her husband, and she felt anxious about him.
She knew how he would feel about Ulick, and
dreaded the consequences. She wished she had
spoken more kindly to him, but he insulted her
with his implied suspicions.</p>

<p class="indent">As the evening wore on, and he did not return,
she became more and more uneasy.</p>

<p class="indent">It was after eleven when she heard the sound
of horse's hoofs coming up the drive, and shortly
after Warren entered the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad you have returned,&quot; she said, softly.
&quot;I was anxious about you. I spoke harshly to
you, perhaps, but I was excited, and hardly knew
what I said. If you wish I will not tell the Squire
about Janet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was surprised at her words. His ride had
done him good, the gallop across country had
aroused him to a better frame of mind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought you would not care what became
of me,&quot; he said. &quot;When I can screw up my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
courage I will tell the Squire Ulick is innocent,
but I cannot do it yet. Give me a little time,
Irene, and all will come right in the end.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope so,&quot; she said. &quot;Do not be reckless
because we have quarrelled. Let us make the
best of things as they are. I am very glad to
hear you have decided to tell the Squire all, it
is the very best thing you can do, and I am sure
it will be a relief to you.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CXVIII" id="CXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>&quot;TALLY-HO!&quot;</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> year passed rapidly away, and the hunting
season was in full swing. The Rushshire hounds
were to meet at Hazelwell, and Ulick saw the
fixture in the paper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By Jove! I should like to have a spin with
them again,&quot; he said to himself; &quot;it is more
than two years since I had a rousing gallop over
our country. I cannot go to Hazelwell, but I
have a good mind to join them as they pass
through Helton village on the way to Brecon
Wood. I'll write to Eli and ask him to put me up
for the night, and he will be able to give me a
mount. My father will be out with the hounds,
and many people will recognise me, but I can
vanish when the hunt is over. It will be amusing
to see how the good folks take it, and whether
they object to my presence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He wrote to Eli, who was in a flutter of excitement
when he received the letter. Of course,
he would give him a bed, and be glad to see him.
&quot;If I could only get Random for him to ride,&quot;
he said to himself, &quot;that would be a treat.
I'll try it on, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>He rode over to Anselm Manor and fortunately
found Irene alone. To her he showed Ulick's
letter and she was delighted to hear he was coming
down.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have come to ask a favour of you,&quot; said Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall have much pleasure in granting it,
if I can,&quot; she replied, with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you lend me Random to mount him on?&quot;
he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall be delighted,&quot; she replied. Then she
wondered what Warren would say, as he would
be sure to inquire where the horse was. She
could tell him she had lent him to Eli for a friend
to ride, as she did not intend to hunt that day,
but merely to be at the breakfast at Hazelwell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can take him back with you now; one
of the grooms can ride over,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Eli was delighted at the success of his plan, and
as he looked at Random in his box, said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will be surprised to have your old master
on your back, but I expect you will know him
again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick arrived at the Hazelwell stud farm, and
Eli greeted him heartily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Something tells me you will not leave us
again,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are wrong, Eli; I cannot go to Hazelwell
yet, not until&mdash;&mdash;&quot; he hesitated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not until what?&quot; asked Eli.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>&quot;Until the man who ran away with Janet
thinks fit to confess to my father,&quot; said Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you will have to wait a long time,&quot;
said Eli, &quot;for he has not got it in him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know him!&quot; exclaimed Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not for certain, but I have a very good idea.
We will not talk about that. Have you heard
anything of Janet?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Ulick. &quot;She is well, and I know is
leading a respectable life, but she cannot come
home at present, and does not wish you to see
her until she has asked you to forgive her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad to hear that, it is good news; but
I should like to have her here again. If you know
where she is, tell her I have forgiven her long
ago.&quot; He did not ask why she did not come home,
but her refusal to do so confirmed his suspicions,
and he thought he understood her reason for
remaining away, and approved of it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have a good mount for you,&quot; said Eli.
&quot;Would you like to see him, or will you wait until
the morning?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We may as well look at him now,&quot; said Ulick,
&quot;and then I can dream of one of the best runs
on record.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They went out and across the yard, Eli lighting
the way with a lantern. He opened the door of
a box near to that in which Ulick entered the
night he gave him such a surprise.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>Holding up the light, Eli said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's not a bad sort, is he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At first Ulick did not recognise the horse, as
the light was not particularly good. He stepped
up to his side, and Random sniffed and pushed
his head against him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He seems to know me,&quot; said Ulick. Then, as
he took another look at him, he exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why it's Random! Good old Random;
where on earth did he spring from?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He patted the horse, and it was quite like the
meeting of two friends after a long separation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I borrowed him,&quot; said Eli.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;From Mrs. Courtly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and she was delighted to lend him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will she be at the meet to-morrow?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, only at the breakfast.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder what Warren will think when he
sees me on him?&quot; thought Ulick. &quot;I expect
she will merely explain that she lent him to Eli,
and not mention my name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked forward eagerly to riding his old
favourite at a meet of the Rushshire hounds again,
and yet he had strange misgivings when he was
dressing, that something was about to happen
which would change the whole course of his
life. He had no inkling as to what it was, but
the impression was there, and he could not get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
rid of it. He said nothing to Eli, and was as
cheerful as usual at breakfast, and when he
mounted Random he almost wished the day was
over. He rode towards Helton, and met several
people on horseback going to Hazelwell. Some
of them recognised him, others he fancied did
so but avoided looking in his direction.</p>

<p class="indent">James Bard, the veterinary surgeon, gave him
a hearty welcome, and insisted on riding back
with him to his house in the village.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am right glad to see you again,&quot; he said,
briskly. &quot;You have been away from us so long.
I hope you have returned to stay.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not yet,&quot; replied Ulick. &quot;I have not been
to Hazelwell; I am going to join them as they
pass through the village; they are sure to draw
Brecon Wood first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I remain with you,&quot; said James Bard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must go to Hazelwell; my father will
miss you at the breakfast, and will be angry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not when he learns why I remained away,&quot;
replied Bard.</p>

<p class="indent">They rode together to James Bard's house,
and remained there until the hounds came in
sight. They stood at the window and watched
them pass, and there was a large muster at the
meet, the Hazelwell hunt breakfast always
drawing a big crowd.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will be comparatively easy to remain unrecognised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
amongst that lot,&quot; said Ulick. &quot;I
did not see my father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Squire has been down with the gout,&quot;
said Bard, &quot;and Dr. Harding has made him rest.
I expect he will chafe a good deal at having to
remain at home to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick was sorry his father had the gout, yet
was glad he was absent from the hunt.</p>

<p class="indent">When the party cleared the village, James
Bard and Ulick rode after them, in the direction
of Brecon Wood.</p>

<p class="indent">As they neared the well-known haunt of the
best foxes in Rushshire, they heard the hounds
making music, and in a few minutes the well-known
cry was heard, and they had &quot;gone away&quot;
after the fox.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick set Random going, and, followed by
James Bard, quickly came in sight of the field.
In front, well ahead, the hounds were streaming
away over some open pastures, the fox going
at a great pace, and the field in straggling order.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's got a capital start,&quot; said Ulick. &quot;We
are in for a good run.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If it's the 'old dog' we went after last
season, he'll make it hot. We shall soon tell,
he generally doubles round and makes for Hazelwell
Coppice at the other side of Glen church.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sixteen miles if it's a yard,&quot; said Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And good going all the way, but there are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
some stiff fences, and we shall have to face the
Tone river.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Swim it or leap it?&quot; laughed Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You'll get over it on that fellow. I don't
know about mine. I fancy I have seen yours
before.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you have. It's Random.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good gracious, so it is. You'll have nothing
to fear, and if anyone is in at the death, it will
be yourself,&quot; said Bard.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not long before Random left the
veterinary surgeon in the rear, and carried
Ulick well to the front of the field. The horse
fenced splendidly, and had a good rider on his
back.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly inquired where Random was,
and Irene told him she had lent him to Eli for a
friend of his to ride, and with this he was satisfied,
and did not ask who he was, much to her relief.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick saw Warren ahead of him on a big Irish
grey, a strong puller, but a good fencer, rather
a dangerous horse to ride when his blood was up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He'll be surprised when he sees me on
Random,&quot; thought Ulick, who had by this time
forgotten all about his early-morning presentiment
in the excitement of the chase.</p>

<p class="indent">They were galloping over a ploughed field, and
the going was heavy, beyond was a meadow, and
in the distance the river Tone could be seen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
It was narrow in some parts, and not deep, but
the banks were treacherous, and often brought
riders to grief.</p>

<p class="indent">Out of the plough into the meadow they went
at a fast pace. The old fox knew his way about,
and bore away to the left. There was an old tree
fallen, three parts of the way across the river, and
he headed for it. Racing along the huge trunk
with sure steps, he reached the end, made a long
jump, and scrambled up the opposite side, and
raced away up the steep incline towards Hazelwell
Spinney and Glen church.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren set the grey at the water, and he
cleared it gallantly. Ulick flew over on Random,
and as they galloped up the hill got ahead of
him, but was not within shouting distance as
he passed him. At first Warren did not see him,
but presently he recognised Random, and then
Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">He was never more surprised in his life than to
see Ulick on Random at that particular moment.
It staggered him for a few minutes, and when
he recovered from the shock he was extremely
angry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So it was to him she lent Random,&quot; he
muttered savagely. &quot;She knew he was here, at
Helton. I wonder if they met when I was out.
You shall suffer for this, Irene. Perhaps he thinks
I am a coward; I'll show him who is the better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
man to-day. Damn him, I'll beat him, or know
the reason why.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He rode the grey roughly, and the horse resented
it. He pulled harder than ever, and the wild
Irish blood in him revolted at his rider's handling.</p>

<p class="indent">Only half-a-dozen horsemen were near them,
the bulk of the field had cut across country,
knowing where the fox was making for. All the
men following the track of the hounds were hard
riders, and would have scorned to adopt such
tactics.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's Ulick Maynard,&quot; muttered the huntsman.
&quot;I'm glad to see him out again, and on
Random too. I wonder what he's done with old
Eli's girl? She was a pretty wench. It was a
bit rough on Eli, that was, and I didn't think
Mr. Ulick was the man to do it. However,
there's no telling what will happen when there's
a woman in the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick was thoroughly enjoying himself. He
loved following the hounds, and had done so ever
since he was a boy. He knew the country well,
and was aware it would take Random all his time
to keep going to the finish at this pace.</p>

<p class="indent">They were nearing Glen church, and beyond,
in the distance, was Hazelwell Coppice, the house
being hidden amongst the trees a couple of miles
away.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick took in the well-remembered scene at a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
glance. He called to mind how he had galloped
over this country with the Squire and Irene, and
how they had found it a difficult task to keep
up with his father. He wished Irene was there
now, so that he could give her a lead over that
big, stiff-set hedge a hundred yards ahead of
him. He forgot all about Warren on the grey.
There were the hounds scrambling through the
bars of the gate, dashing through the holes in
the hedge near the bank. Once he caught sight
of the fox streaking along with his tail straight
out, his head down, and his body almost level
with the ground.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's not half done yet,&quot; thought Ulick. &quot;He
deserves to get away, and I hope he will save his
brush.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The fox meant doing so if possible, there could
be no doubt about that.</p>

<p class="indent">Round Glen church was a high, rough stone
wall, built in the old style, stone piled upon stone,
not bound together in any way, except by the
pressure of one upon another. The coping on
the top was loose, and in places big stones had
rolled off on to the grass, for the church stood
in a field, and was approached by a footpath.</p>

<p class="indent">The fox seemed of a pious turn of mind, for
he headed straight for the church, as though
hoping to find sanctuary there from his desperate
pursuers.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>Ulick expected to see him run round the churchyard,
but instead of that he scrambled up the
wall and made his way amongst the tombstones
and over the graves of men who had hunted his
ancestors in years gone by.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you think I am going to follow you over
there you are mistaken,&quot; said Ulick. &quot;I have
no desire to join the silent residents in that
locality. I'll ride round and catch you up on the
other side, it is not far out of the way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He watched the hounds scrambling over the
rough wall, which stood on a rise on the ground,
and saw from their movements they were well-nigh
beaten.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly was not far behind. He
saw Ulick check his mount, and then make for
the corner of the churchyard. He was near
enough to be heard, if he shouted, and he called
out&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Follow me over the wall, if you have pluck
enough; don't sneak round that way.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CXIX" id="CXIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>A FATAL LEAP.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ulick</span> heard him, and, turning round, saw the grey
galloping at a great pace straight for the churchyard
wall. He did not accept the challenge; it
would have been madness to do so. He called
at the top of his voice to Warren to stop.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He'll never clear it! Pull up!&quot; shouted
Ulick, excitedly.</p>

<p class="indent">For answer, Warren merely looked in his direction,
and smiled grimly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come on!&quot; he shouted again. &quot;Are you
afraid?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick was not afraid, but he had no desire to
break his neck, and that was probably what
Warren would do if the grey failed to top the wall.
There was no chance of stopping him, and Ulick
determined to see the result of the dare-devil leap.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's mad to attempt it!&quot; he said. &quot;The
horse is a good one, but he'll never get over it.
I would not risk it on Random for a fortune!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was no one else near; the four or five
horsemen had skirted round the wall, and were
riding hard after the hounds, who had by this time
cleared the churchyard.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>Ulick waited for Warren's rash leap, and his
heart almost stopped beating in his intense anxiety
to see him safely over.</p>

<p class="indent">The presentiment of the morning flashed across
his mind, and he wondered if this was to be the
result.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren knew what lay before him; but his
blood was up, and so was the grey's. The horse
pricked his ears as he saw the formidable obstacle
in front of him, but he did not shirk his work.
On the contrary, he regulated his stride, and prepared
for the desperate leap.</p>

<p class="indent">As Warren drew near to the wall Ulick rode
forward, in order to render assistance should it be
required, for he feared the result, and wished to
do all in his power to help him.</p>

<p class="indent">Up the incline galloped the grey. Had the wall
stood on the level he might have jumped it,
although that was doubtful. The horse took off
well, rose at the wall, and would have cleared it
safely but for the fact that a huge raised gravestone,
over a vault in the churchyard, stood
close beneath it.</p>

<p class="indent">The horse saw it, tried to avoid it as he leaped,
caught his hind legs on the wall, fell heavily forward,
and threw Warren with terrific force head
first on to the slab.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick heard the crash and shuddered. Horse
and rider failed to rise. He rode quickly to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
spot, flung Random's bridle over a big coping
stone, and scrambled over the wall, almost falling
over the horse as he landed on the other side.
He merely cast a rapid glance at the grey, and
saw he was fatally injured, and rushed forward to
Warren Courtly, who lay stretched out on the top
of the slab where he had fallen.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick stooped over him, and said, in an agitated
voice&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Warren! Warren! are you alive? Speak
to me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was no answer, no movement in the body,
which lay dangerously still and inanimate.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick tore open his vest and collar, and lifted
him up. As he did so the head fell back, resting
on his chest, and for a moment the eyes opened
with the shock, but quickly closed again.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick shuddered. That limp movement of the
head, he knew what it meant. There was no hope.
Warren's neck was broken. He had pitched on
to his head, and the fall was bound to be fatal.
He supported the dead man for a considerable time,
hoping against hope that he would show some sign
of life. His thoughts wandered to Irene, and he
wondered how she would bear the shock. He must
break it to her as gently as possible. She must
hear it from no one but himself. He was of no
use here. Warren was beyond human aid. He
laid the body gently down, and covered the face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
with a handkerchief; it looked weird and uncanny,
resting there in the scarlet coat on the top of a
vault, in the picturesque old churchyard.</p>

<p class="indent">Getting over the wall, he remounted Random and
rode away for assistance.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no one in sight. Then he espied
two figures in the distance walking towards him;
one was his father, the other Irene. They saw
him, and his father waved his stick. There
was no excuse; he had to pull up and meet
them.</p>

<p class="indent">He was bewildered, at a loss what to do, what
to say; and as he thought of Warren lying still
in the churchyard he shuddered, and was almost
tempted to make a bolt.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are not often out of the hunt,&quot; said the
Squire. &quot;Irene let the cat out of the bag, and told
me you were here, and that Eli had borrowed
Random for you. I am glad to see you out with
the hounds again, but you ought to have come to
breakfast.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you had a fall, or missed the hounds?&quot;
asked Irene. &quot;I am afraid I have taught Random
bad manners. Have you seen Warren?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He made no answer, but looked vacantly before
him, and she said, anxiously, as she noticed the
green moss from the stone on his coat&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you hurt yourself? You look as though
you have had a fall.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>&quot;I have not had a fall,&quot; he said, in a voice
strangely unlike his own.</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire was quick at reading faces, and knew
something had happened. Did it concern Irene?
Had Warren been injured? He took her by the
arm and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, let us go home; and, as Ulick has missed
the hounds, he can come with us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene hesitated. She felt Ulick was concealing
something, either from her or his father. What
was it? Had anything happened to her husband?</p>

<p class="indent">She stepped forward before he dismounted,
placing her hand on Random's neck, and, looking
up into his face, said, quickly&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Something has happened; I can see it in
your face. There has been an accident. Is it
Warren?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He avoided her gaze. How could he tell her,
and the churchyard where he lay quite close by?</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire saw there was serious news, and
said, as cheerfully as possible&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has Warren had a spill? I hope it is not
serious.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, he had a bad fall. I have just left
him. I was riding for assistance when I met you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Irene turned white, and the Squire supported
her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is he?&quot; she said. &quot;Let me go to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick dismounted and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>&quot;You must be brave, Irene! Warren has had
a very bad fall.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is he?&quot; she asked again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He attempted to leap the churchyard wall
and follow the hounds. It is a dangerous jump,
and the horse fell, throwing him heavily.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why do you delay? Ride for assistance
at once! We will go to him,&quot; she said, and started
off at a rapid pace in the direction of Glen church.</p>

<p class="indent">This was Ulick's opportunity. He stepped up to
his father, and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do what you can to comfort her. He's in
the churchyard, lying on Harewood's vault. I
am better away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is not&mdash;&mdash;?&quot; asked the Squire, and paused.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick nodded. &quot;He fell on his head on the
slab and broke his neck. Now go after her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Call out to her to stop; I can hardly limp
along,&quot; said the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Irene!&quot; called Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent">She turned round, and he pointed to his father.</p>

<p class="indent">She came hurriedly back, and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take my arm&mdash;we will go together.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick mounted Random and rode rapidly away
to Hazelwell, where he ordered a carriage and the
requisite necessaries to be sent to the church, and
dispatched a man for the doctor.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile the Squire and Irene were nearing
Glen church.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>&quot;Irene,&quot; he said, in a low voice, &quot;Ulick has
told me Warren is very badly injured; you must
be prepared for the worst.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked at him with frightened eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Prepared for the worst!&quot; she muttered.
&quot;Is his life in danger?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She gave a little sharp cry, and hurried forward
again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You had better remain with me,&quot; he called,
and she obeyed him without a murmur.</p>

<p class="indent">They reached the churchyard, and passed under
the porch through the gateway, and at the far
side, near the wall, the Squire saw a red coat on
a tombstone; then he distinguished the form of
a man. Irene had not seen it, and he led her down a
side path.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be brave, Irene!&quot; he said. &quot;If he is in danger
you will have to summon up all your courage to
help him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will,&quot; she said; &quot;indeed I will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she saw the red coat, and started back,
her hand pressed against her heart, her eyes filled
with horror.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is lying on the stone on the top of a vault,&quot;
she said, in a hollow voice. &quot;How did he get
there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She stumbled forward over the graves,
leaving the Squire to follow. She grazed her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
ankles, but heeded not, and at last she reached
him.</p>

<p class="indent">Snatching the handkerchief away, she stood
looking at his face, with the closed eyes and the
black mark on the neck. She stood perfectly still;
no cry came from her; but her look of horror told
she knew he was dead.</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire reached her just as she fell forward,
insensible, on her husband's body. He lifted her
tenderly in his arms, and sat down on the slab.
With one hand he drew the handkerchief over
Warren's face again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is a sad blow,&quot; he thought. &quot;It is a
blessing she is insensible. It may be all for the
best.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He allowed her to remain in this state for some
minutes, and then tried to rouse her. His foot
pained him, but he scarcely felt it.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene opened her eyes and shuddered. At first
she did not realise where she was, but, as she
caught sight of the gravestones, they recalled all.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is dead!&quot; she said, slowly. &quot;Poor Warren!
he is dead!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The tears came to her relief, and the Squire
remained silent, with his arm supporting her.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly she flung herself on Warren's body and
moaned bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire placed his hand on her shoulder, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>&quot;Irene, bear up; there is much to be done.
We must take him home&mdash;to Hazelwell first, if
you wish; it is nearer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no!&quot; she said. &quot;To the Manor. I want
to be there with him alone!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The carriage came, and was closely followed by
Ulick and Dr. Harding, who examined Warren,
and found his neck broken.</p>

<p class="indent">Tenderly they placed him in the carriage.
Irene insisted upon getting in, and the Squire
followed her, saying to Ulick&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You and Dr. Harding had better follow us to
the Manor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly was taken back to his home,
which he had left in the morning full of health and
spirits, if not happiness. He little thought, when
he mounted the fiery grey, how he was to return.</p>

<p class="indent">The news of the fatal accident soon spread, but
it had not reached Anselm Manor, and there was
consternation when they arrived.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Dixon did all in her power for her mistress,
and managed to calm and soothe her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is dreadful!&quot; moaned Irene.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not love Warren, but the shock
of his death affected her terribly. It was so sudden,
so unlooked for; and he was so young. She
could hardly believe it. Dixon remained with her
during the night, and towards early morning she
sank into a troubled slumber.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>&quot;I cannot remain here,&quot; said Ulick, soon after
their arrival. &quot;It would not be right for me to
do so. You will remain, father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; but you must go to Hazelwell,&quot; was the
reply.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren was dead, and Irene knew nothing of
his connection with Janet. He was glad of that;
he had no hesitation in going to Hazelwell now.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will,&quot; he replied, and the Squire gave a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Home again, at last!&quot; he thought. &quot;Warren's
death has brought us together again; once at
Hazelwell he will not leave it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Warren Courtly was buried in Anselm church,
in the vault where several of his ancestors reposed;
and Irene was a widow, having been only a very
short time a wife, and that only in name.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a shock to the county, and the members
of the Rushshire Hunt in particular, and it was
generally acknowledged Warren's rashness at
attempting such a leap caused his early death.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick and the Squire examined the wall where
the grey and his rider were killed, and the latter
said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder what made him attempt it? As a
rule he was not rash.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick explained what had happened, and how
Warren had dared him to follow him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder sometimes if he was angry because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
Irene lent me Random to ride, and that caused
him to act as he did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should not be disposed to look at it in that
light,&quot; answered his father. &quot;He may have been
surprised to see you out, more especially on
Random; but there was no harm in your riding
him. There was something else at the bottom of
the challenge he threw out to you. Did you ever
doubt his courage?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I did, he was unaware of it,&quot; was the answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then it must have been in a sudden fit of rashness
he did it,&quot; said the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">Janet Todd read the account of the fatal accident
to Warren Courtly in the paper, but she
did not grieve much over his death, although she
felt sorry it had taken place. There was nothing
now to hinder her returning to her father, and it
was the only thing she could do, as she had very
little money.</p>

<p class="indent">She wrote to Eli begging his forgiveness, and
asking if he would take her back. Needless to
say, his reply was loving and fatherly, and he
implored her to come home without delay.</p>

<p class="indent">Janet returned, and Eli&mdash;good, large-hearted
man that he was&mdash;received her with open arms,
and she was grateful for his kindness.</p>

<p class="indent">Some weeks after her return he said to her one
night&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Janet, I had made up my mind never to allude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
to the past, but I will ask you one question and
have done with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She knew what the question was, and decided
there could be no harm in answering it now, more
especially as Irene knew the whole circumstances.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will answer any question you care to ask me,&quot;
she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who induced you to run away and leave me?&quot;
he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Warren Courtly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought as much,&quot; was his reply.</p>

<h2><a name="CXX" id="CXX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>PERFECT HARMONY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was over twelve months since Warren Courtly
came to an untimely end, and the Squire and his
son were in the morning-room, where he had kept
vigil on the anniversary of Ulick's departure.
There was no snow on this occasion, as they looked
out of the window at the familiar scene; but the
ground was held in the grip of a hard frost, and
the white crystals had not yet vanished from the
trees.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Irene is coming for dinner to-night,&quot; said the
Squire, as he looked at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And who else is coming?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only Dr. Harding and the Vicar and his wife,&quot;
replied his father.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick did not immediately reply, but stood at
the window while the Squire sat down.</p>

<p class="indent">Bersak, who was lying on the hearthrug, went
to him and licked his hand. He patted the dog's
head, but, as he made no movement to go away,
Bersak went and laid down at the Squire's
feet.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>During the months that had elapsed since
Warren's death he had seen very little of Irene,
had, in fact, avoided her as much as possible, and
absented himself a good deal from Hazelwell, his
excuse being that he liked to see his horses run,
especially the Saint.</p>

<p class="indent">The &quot;curiosity&quot; had won some good handicaps,
and, at the Squire's request, he had been sent
down to Hazelwell at the end of his four-year-old
career, much to Fred May's chagrin, as he wished
to keep him in work, and said it was throwing
money away to send him to the stud at that age.
Ulick, however, wished to please his father, so
the Saint was now an important member of the
Hazelwell stud, and Eli Todd was as proud of him
as the trainer had been.</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire knew it was not altogether racing
that caused his son to vanish from home for weeks
at a time. He appreciated the delicacy of feeling
which actuated him and took him away from
Irene's presence in the early months of her widowhood.
He saw in his conduct a sure sign that he
was in love with her, and he gleaned from
Irene's look of disappointment, when she saw
Ulick was absent, that she returned his
affection.</p>

<p class="indent">It had always been a thorn in the Squire's side
that he had induced Irene to marry Warren
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
Courtly, who was unsuited to her, and had thus
placed an insurmountable barrier in Ulick's
way.</p>

<p class="indent">By an accident that obstacle had been removed,
and he did not intend his cherished idea should
again come to nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">The Squire did not mourn for Warren Courtly.
He was no hypocrite, and, although sorry for his
early death, he argued that it was all for the best,
more especially when he came to examine into his
affairs, and afterwards when he had made Janet
tell him who had run away with her. This she
did on giving his word he would keep her
secret.</p>

<p class="indent">Warren, who had left the Squire joint executor
with Irene, had involved the Anselm estate
heavily, and it would take some years to wipe
off the debt that had accumulated. Irene had
a considerable income, but not more than half
she had a right to have expected. There
was a mortgage on the Manor itself, but
the Squire quickly took that up on his own
account.</p>

<p class="indent">As Ulick looked out of the window, his thoughts
were busy with memories of the past, and in them
Irene was a conspicuous figure. He had waited
more than twelve months, and held his peace,
although he was impatient to pour out his love to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
her now she was free. He was thinking whether
he would have an opportunity of doing so to-night,
and, if it occurred, whether he would take it.
What would her answer be? He did not wish to
be over-confident, but he looked forward to a
favourable reply, and his heart beat fast in
expectation.</p>

<p class="indent">He was not aware Irene knew who
ran away with Janet, and he was pleased
to think she had no knowledge of Warren's
conduct.</p>

<p class="indent">His father watched him with a smile on his
face, and thought&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He means to ask her to-night. He is
making up his mind, and I will see he has the
chance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is there anything particularly striking to look
at out there?&quot; asked the Squire. &quot;If so, I will
join you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick laughed as he replied, &quot;I was taking very
little notice of the view. I was thinking over old
times.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pleasant thoughts?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, most of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We were a couple of fools to remain separated
for such a long time,&quot; said the Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We appreciate being together again the more
now,&quot; replied Ulick.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>&quot;Eli is precious glad to have that girl of his
back again,&quot; said the Squire. &quot;I hope the lesson
she has had will teach her to behave better in the
future.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no fear about that,&quot; replied Ulick.
&quot;It has been severe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not nearly so severe as she deserved,&quot; was
the reply.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a merry dinner party, and they were all
in high spirits. Later on in the evening the
Squire and the Vicar's wife challenged the Vicar
and the Doctor to a quiet rubber, which was
eagerly accepted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You two young people can look after yourselves,&quot;
said the Squire to Irene and his son, and
she flushed slightly at his words.</p>

<p class="indent">Whist was an interesting game to the players,
but Ulick and Irene evidently found it slow as
spectators, and quietly left the room.</p>

<p class="indent">A bright fire was blazing in the drawing-room,
and Irene sat down at the piano and idly ran her
hands over the keys. The lamps shed a soft,
yellow light over the room, and the effect was
soothing and tranquil.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Irene sang a simple song, and,
when it was ended, went on with another.
She was fond of music; so was Ulick, and he
listened to her sweet, low notes, and watched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
her face as she sang, half unconscious of his
presence.</p>

<p class="indent">When she stopped and looked up she found him
standing near her. Their eyes met, and, taking
her hand, he said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Irene, I have something to say to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She knew what he meant, and knew what her
answer must be.</p>

<p class="indent">He pleaded his cause well, and she listened,
smiling encouragement when he faltered.</p>

<p class="indent">He asked her to be his wife, and she consented
without any false hesitation.</p>

<p class="indent">They were very happy, and Ulick felt that somehow
the world was a very good place to live in, and
that the ways of life were not quite so crooked as
some people were desirous of making out.</p>

<p class="indent">He could not realise that Irene had ever been
Warren Courtly's wife. He seemed to have
possessed her ever since she came to Hazelwell
on the death of her father. She was his Irene,
always had been, and always would be for ever
more.</p>

<p class="indent">And Irene was very happy. She knew her
brief life with Warren had been all a mistake.
She regretted his death, and the manner of it,
but it had not blighted her life. She had known
of people who had mourned distractedly the
loss of a dear one, and in a few months had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
changed the garments of widowhood for those
of marriage.</p>

<p class="indent">In a few years Warren would be merely a
memory, nothing more, and it had been his own
fault. Having neglected her during life, it was
not reasonable to expect he would be reverenced
when dead.</p>

<p class="indent">She knew she had always loved Ulick, although
she had been unaware of it, and now the realisation
of her happiness was at hand.</p>

<p class="indent">She was to remain at Hazelwell for the night,
and when the other guests departed the Squire
was told what had happened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I knew it was coming,&quot; he said, joyfully.
&quot;I saw it in your faces. Come and kiss
me, Irene; you are not jealous, are you,
Ulick?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at all,&quot; he replied, laughing; &quot;but I envy
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Not had one
yet?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dozens,&quot; whispered Irene, in his ear, and the
Squire laughed heartily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You recollect this room when I sat up all
night waiting for Ulick to return?&quot; said the
Squire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Irene; and then she added, &quot;it
is the very day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>&quot;So it is, my child,&quot; he replied, &quot;and I take
it as a happy omen for your married life.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">In the summer, when the trees were full of leaf,
and the birds carolled their sweetest and best,
Ulick and Irene were married. It was a quiet
wedding, and they went abroad for some considerable
time. On their return they resided at
Anselm Manor, and the Squire divided his time
between Hazelwell and their home.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick had learned from his wife that she knew
all about Janet and Warren, and it was not long
before they found out that the Squire was in
possession of the facts. As for Janet, she accepted
the position of lady's maid to Irene when Mary
Marley and Bob Heather were married. This
bold move on Irene's part effectually silenced the
gossips, who clung to the belief that Ulick was
the cause of Janet's trouble, and that they had
run away together. It was acknowledged that
Mrs. Maynard would never have had Janet in
her service had such been the case.</p>

<p class="indent">Happiness reigned supreme at Anselm Manor,
and when the Squire heard of the arrival of a son,
and that he was a grandfather, he gave a whoop
of joy that startled the decorous quietude of
Hazelwell.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>&quot;And if it isn't on the very day, the same day
that Ulick left me, and the day on which Irene
consented to be his wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The new arrival made the Squire feel young
again, and no signs were wanting that the little
one would be a prime favourite with him.</p>

<p class="indent">Years soon roll by and time never stands still.
The child grew into a fine boy, and there were
others to keep him company. There was every
sign that Anselm Manor would be the home of
many happy children. The laughter of youth
rang through the old rooms, and echoed down the
passages and along the walls, where monks and
friars had revelled and prayed and told their
beads hundreds of years before. Anselm Manor
had taken on a new lease of life; a new
spirit was infused into it&mdash;the buoyant spirit
of youth.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick and his wife were often seen in the
hunting field, and occasionally at some of the
principal race meetings; and there was much
rejoicing at Hazelwell when Fred May pulled off
the Jockey Club Stakes with the colt out of
Honeysuckle, that had only just escaped being
born nearly &quot;a year old.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Saint was making a name at the stud, and
his early foals were promising, but none of them
were the colour of their sire.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>Ulick, however, wanted a grey by him, and in
due time got his wish, and a promising youngster
he looked.</p>

<p class="indent">Janet did not forget Mrs. Hoffman. The
woman had been kind to her in her way, and she
often received a present from the Manor. As for
Felix Hoffman, he got into trouble with the police,
and had to leave the country in a hurry, only just
escaping the meshes of the law, in which he
thoroughly deserved to be entangled.</p>

<p class="indent">Squire Maynard, so everyone said, had grown
young since his son's marriage with Irene, and a
fine, noble country gentleman he looked as he
walked or rode, with his grandson on a cob at his
side.</p>

<p class="indent">Young Ulick was very like the Squire, who saw
his own youth reflected in him, and indulged him
accordingly.</p>

<p class="indent">Irene, as a mother, was far more attractive
than she had ever been before, and her husband
and children adored her. They were proud
of her good looks and of the admiration she
invariably excited.</p>

<p class="indent">Ulick sometimes thought of that fatal leap
Warren Courtly took when he passed Glen church,
and saw again the red-coated figure on the cold
slab near the wall, but the melancholy remembrance
quickly vanished. There is too much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
sunshine in his life to be hidden by passing clouds,
and happiness leaves no room for discord.
Everything is in harmony; there are no jarring
notes; and long may it be so with them all.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">www.gutenberg.org/license</a>.</p>

<h3>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

<p>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and
the Foundation information page at <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<h3>Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

throughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809
North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
